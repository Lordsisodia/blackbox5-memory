## Problem Statement

Blackbox5 project memory is incomplete and uses an outdated 7-folder structure. It lacks:
- 7 of 8 required root files
- Proper template system
- Consistent documentation patterns
- Integration with RALF-Core content

## Goals

1. Restructure to 6-folder standard (remove domains/)
2. Create all 26 templates from siso-internal patterns
3. Migrate RALF-Core content into blackbox5
4. Create example content demonstrating templates
5. Update all documentation

## Success Criteria

- [x] All 26 templates created
- [x] 8 root files present
- [x] domains/ folder removed
- [x] .docs/ folders in each main folder
- [x] 40 tasks migrated
- [x] 45 runs archived
- [x] Example epic created
- [x] README.md updated

## Dependencies

- siso-internal patterns documented
- RALF-Core backup available

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Content loss during migration | Backup created before changes |
| Template adoption slow | Create example content |
