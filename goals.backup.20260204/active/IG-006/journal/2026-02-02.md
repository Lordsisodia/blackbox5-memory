## IG-006: Restructure BlackBox5 Architecture

### What We Did Today

Major progress on the architecture restructuring. Successfully migrated 107 tasks from `.autonomous/tasks/` to root `tasks/` folder. Each task now has its own folder with a `task.md` file inside.

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Keep .autonomous as dot-folder**: It sorts to the top and stays hidden from normal directory listings, which is nice for keeping agent runtime data out of the way.

2. **Organize by agent type**: Created `agents/{planner,executor,architect}/` structure with each having `state/`, `metrics/`, and `runs/` folders.

3. **Move project management to root**: Tasks and goals are project-level, not agent-level, so they belong at root.

4. **Goals infrastructure**: Designed a proper goals system with:
   - Core goals (perpetual, in `core/`)
   - Improvement goals (in `active/` and `completed/`)
   - Sub-goals inline in goal.yaml
   - Timeline (structured) + Journal (narrative)
   - Auto-calculated progress from linked tasks

### Challenges

- Had to deal with three different task systems (legacy root tasks/, .autonomous/tasks/, and the new structure)
- Runs were scattered across 5 different locations
- Lots of empty folders that needed cleaning up

### What's Next

1. Complete documentation (SG-006-2)
2. Clean up remaining empty folders
3. Update any scripts that reference old paths
4. Validate agents can find their data

### Thoughts

The architecture is much cleaner now. The separation is clear:
- `.autonomous/` = Agent runtime data (state, runs, communications)
- Root = Project management (tasks, goals, plans, operations)

This should make it much easier for both humans and agents to navigate.
