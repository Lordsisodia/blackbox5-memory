# Aqua Voice Prompt Iteration Log

## 2026-02-04: v1.0.0-baseline Created

**Trigger:** Initial research and setup
**Changes:**
- Created baseline prompt based on superintelligence protocol research
- Balanced approach: removes fillers but preserves semantic markers
- Includes Markdown structure and context tagging

**Rationale:**
Research showed that heavy processing loses important nuance (uncertainty markers, scope constraints). This baseline keeps a middle ground—clean enough for AI parsing, but preserves enough context for accurate interpretation.

**Next Steps:**
1. User testing in real scenarios
2. Document what works/doesn't work
3. Design v1.1.0 based on findings
