  Learning Index Auto-Generated

  This index is automatically populated by the learning_extractor.py library
  after each task completion. Manual edits should maintain the YAML structure.

  Index structure:
  - learnings: Array of learning objects extracted from tasks
  - patterns: Array of recurring patterns identified across tasks
  - statistics: Aggregated statistics for quick querying
  - maintenance: Index maintenance tracking

  Usage:
  - Query with knowledge_retriever.py: python3 -m knowledge_retriever search "import error"
  - Find patterns with pattern_matcher.py: python3 -m pattern_matcher patterns
  - Apply learnings with learning_applier.py: python3 -m learning_applier inject --task-id TASK-XXX --title "My Task"

  Maintenance:
  - Rebuild: python3 -m learning_extractor rebuild-index
  - Cleanup: python3 -m learning_extractor cleanup-index
  - Update effectiveness: python3 -m learning_applier update-effectiveness
