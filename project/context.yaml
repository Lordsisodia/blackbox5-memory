# BlackBox5 Project Context

project:
  name: "BlackBox5"
  version: "5.1.0"
  status: "active"
  created: "2026-01-20"
  updated: "2026-01-20"

identity:
  type: "autonomous-agent-framework"
  description: "Next-generation autonomous agent system with hierarchical memory, multi-agent orchestration, and self-improvement capabilities"
  purpose: "Enable AI agents to work autonomously on complex software engineering tasks with minimal human intervention"

vision: |
  BlackBox5 aims to create a fully autonomous agent system that can:
  - Understand complex software engineering tasks
  - Plan and execute multi-step solutions
  - Learn from experience and improve over time
  - Coordinate multiple specialized agents
  - Maintain rich context across sessions
  - Execute safely with proper guardrails

goals:
  primary:
    - "Complete migration of BlackBox3/BlackBox4 capabilities to BlackBox5"
    - "Implement hierarchical memory system with compression"
    - "Build agent discovery and routing system"
    - "Integrate researched frameworks (BMAD, SpecKit, MetaGPT, Swarm)"
    - "Create comprehensive safety and execution guardrails"

  secondary:
    - "Achieve 90% token compression without context loss"
    - "Support 50+ verified skills across all categories"
    - "Enable autonomous self-improvement workflows"
    - "Provide transparent observability and debugging"

constraints:
  technical:
    - "Must maintain compatibility with existing MCP integrations"
    - "Must support both synchronous and asynchronous agent workflows"
    - "Must handle token limits efficiently (target: 90% compression)"
    - "Must be testable and debuggable"

  operational:
    - "Single agent should be able to run autonomously for hours"
    - "System must recover gracefully from failures"
    - "All actions must be auditable and reversible"

  scope:
    - "Focus on autonomous software engineering tasks"
    - "Prioritize agent coordination over single-agent optimization"
    - "Emphasize memory and learning over raw reasoning power"

current_state:
  migration:
    status: "in_progress"
    progress: "47%"
    remaining:
      - "Memory system integration"
      - "Agent type migration"
      - "Skills verification (33/70 complete)"
      - "Framework integration"

  capabilities:
    agents: "50 agents across 5 major types"
    skills: "70 skills, 33 verified (47%)"
    frameworks: "4 integrated, 11 researched"
    memory: "Basic hierarchical, no compression yet"

  gaps:
    critical:
      - "Memory compression not implemented"
      - "Agent discovery and routing missing"
      - "Learning system not functional"
      - "Safety guardrails incomplete"

    high:
      - "Many skills not verified"
      - "Framework integration incomplete"
      - "Observability limited"
      - "Testing coverage low"

direction:
  immediate:
    - "Fix critical bugs (skills system, YAML loading, import paths)"
    - "Complete memory compression implementation"
    - "Verify all remaining skills"

  short_term:
    - "Build agent discovery system"
    - "Implement learning from experience"
    - "Complete framework integrations"

  long_term:
    - "Autonomous self-improvement"
    - "Multi-agent collaboration patterns"
    - "Production deployment"

success_metrics:
  autonomy:
    - "Average autonomous session duration: >4 hours"
    - "Human interventions per session: <2"

  quality:
    - "Task success rate: >85%"
    - "Regression rate: <5%"

  efficiency:
    - "Token compression: >90%"
    - "Average task completion time: <30 minutes"
