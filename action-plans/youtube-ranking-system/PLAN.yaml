# Implementation Plan: YouTube Channel Ranking System

## Overview

Build a complete ELO-style/benchmark ranking system for 362+ YouTube channels to determine which creators provide the most educational value. The system will calculate composite scores from multiple dimensions (knowledge density, engagement, consistency, quality, impact, novelty) and generate tier-based leaderboards.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 362+ channels have calculated scores
- [ ] Leaderboard generated with S/A/B/C/D tiers
- [ ] Category-specific rankings (Data Science, ML/AI, Programming, etc.)
- [ ] Trending detection (rising/falling channels)
- [ ] Static HTML dashboard generated
- [ ] Daily automated recalculation via GitHub Actions

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Scoring Engine (4 hours)

**TASK-YT-RANK-001: Create channel scoring module**
- [ ] Implement `scripts/scoring/engine.py` with composite scoring algorithm
- [ ] Define scoring weights (Knowledge 25%, Engagement 20%, Consistency 20%, Quality 15%, Impact 15%, Novelty 5%)
- [ ] Create normalization functions for each metric
- [ ] Add unit tests for scoring functions

**TASK-YT-RANK-002: Build data aggregation pipeline**
- [ ] Implement `scripts/scoring/aggregate.py` to collect video metrics per channel
- [ ] Calculate channel-level statistics (avg views, upload frequency, total videos)
- [ ] Store aggregated data in `database/channel_metrics.json`
- [ ] Handle missing data gracefully

**TASK-YT-RANK-003: Implement tier classification**
- [ ] Create tier assignment logic (S: 90-100, A: 80-89, B: 70-79, C: 60-69, D: <60)
- [ ] Build `scripts/scoring/tiers.py` for classification
- [ ] Add tier distribution analysis

### Phase 2: Advanced Metrics (4 hours)

**TASK-YT-RANK-004: Calculate engagement quality scores**
- [ ] Implement engagement rate calculation (likes/views, comments/views)
- [ ] Add view velocity tracking (views per hour since upload)
- [ ] Create subscriber conversion metrics
- [ ] Store in `database/engagement_scores.json`

**TASK-YT-RANK-005: Calculate consistency scores**
- [ ] Analyze upload regularity (std dev of intervals)
- [ ] Measure quality consistency over time
- [ ] Factor in channel longevity and total output
- [ ] Store in `database/consistency_scores.json`

**TASK-YT-RANK-006: Calculate knowledge density (basic)**
- [ ] Implement transcript word count / duration ratio
- [ ] Add technical term density estimation (keyword matching)
- [ ] Create code snippet detection in descriptions
- [ ] Store in `database/knowledge_scores.json`

### Phase 3: Ranking & Leaderboard Generation (4 hours)

**TASK-YT-RANK-007: Build ranking calculator**
- [ ] Implement `scripts/ranking/calculate.py` to combine all scores
- [ ] Calculate overall composite scores for each channel
- [ ] Generate rankings (overall + per-category)
- [ ] Store results in `database/channel_rankings.json`

**TASK-YT-RANK-008: Create category classification**
- [ ] Build `scripts/ranking/categories.py` to classify channels
- [ ] Define category mappings (Data Science, ML/AI, Programming, Web Dev, etc.)
- [ ] Handle multi-category channels
- [ ] Store category assignments

**TASK-YT-RANK-009: Implement trending detection**
- [ ] Calculate score changes over time
- [ ] Identify rising/falling channels
- [ ] Detect new entrants and breakthrough creators
- [ ] Store trend data in `database/trends.json`

**TASK-YT-RANK-010: Generate leaderboard reports**
- [ ] Build `scripts/reports/leaderboard.py`
- [ ] Create markdown reports with tables
- [ ] Generate top 100 overall
- [ ] Generate category-specific leaderboards
- [ ] Add trending section
- [ ] Save to `reports/leaderboards/`

### Phase 4: Dashboard & Automation (4 hours)

**TASK-YT-RANK-011: Build HTML dashboard**
- [ ] Create `scripts/dashboard/generate.py`
- [ ] Generate static HTML with CSS styling
- [ ] Add interactive sorting/filtering (vanilla JS)
- [ ] Create channel detail cards
- [ ] Add comparison visualization
- [ ] Output to `dashboard/index.html`

**TASK-YT-RANK-012: Setup GitHub Actions automation**
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/rank-channels.yml`
- [ ] Schedule daily ranking recalculation
- [ ] Auto-commit leaderboard updates
- [ ] Add notification on significant rank changes
- [ ] Test workflow end-to-end

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- yt-dlp (already installed)
- Python 3.11+ (available)
- GitHub Actions (configured)

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing video database in `database/videos.json`
- Channel metadata in `config/sources.yaml`
- Mirror workflow already operational

## Resource Requirements

### People
- Claude (primary implementer)
- User (review and approval)

### Tools and Infrastructure
- Existing YouTube scraper infrastructure
- GitHub Actions runners (free tier)
- JSON file storage (no database needed)

## Timeline

### Milestone 1: Core Engine Complete - Day 1
All scoring functions implemented and tested

### Milestone 2: All Metrics Calculated - Day 2
All 362+ channels have complete scores

### Milestone 3: Leaderboard Live - Day 3
First leaderboard generated and published

### Milestone 4: Dashboard & Automation - Day 4
HTML dashboard live, daily automation running

**Total Estimated Hours:** 16

## Definition of Done

This improvement is complete when:
- [ ] All 12 tasks implemented and tested
- [ ] 362+ channels have calculated scores
- [ ] Leaderboard reports generated in `reports/leaderboards/`
- [ ] HTML dashboard accessible at `dashboard/index.html`
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow running daily
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No critical bugs remain

## Readiness Checklist

Before moving to active:
- [x] All tasks broken down into actionable items
- [x] All dependencies resolved
- [x] Resources allocated
- [x] Timeline estimated
- [x] Design approved (see RANKING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md)

## Next Steps

1. Start TASK-YT-RANK-001: Create channel scoring module
2. Implement sequentially through all phases
3. Test each component before moving to next
4. Generate first leaderboard by end of Phase 3
5. Deploy automation in Phase 4
