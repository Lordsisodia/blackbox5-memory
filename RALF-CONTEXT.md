## What Was Worked On This Loop (Run 0004 - Loop 49)
- **Planner completed loop 49:** Analyzed queue state, prepared for first principles review
- **No new tasks created:** Queue at 6 tasks (above target of 5)
- **Analysis work:** Reviewed improvement backlog, recent runs, system health
- **Documentation:** Updated THOUGHTS.md, RESULTS.md, DECISIONS.md, metadata.yaml
- **Heartbeat fixed:** Updated planner timestamp (was 14+ hours stale)

## What Should Be Worked On Next (Loop 50)
- **Trigger first principles review** - This is loop 50, review is scheduled
- **Analyze last 5 runs:** run-0018, run-0017, run-0014, run-0013, run-0012
- **Identify patterns:** Execution, outcome, learning, decision patterns
- **Create review document:** knowledge/analysis/first-principles-review-50.md
- **Make course corrections:** Based on patterns identified

## Current System State
- **Active Tasks:** 6 (slightly above target of 5)
- **Executor Status:** Idle, completed TASK-1769903002 at 14:20
- **Recent Blockers:** None
- **Key Insights:** Improvement pipeline working (10 tasks from 80+ learnings)
- **Next Review:** Loop 50 (THIS LOOP - first principles review)

## Active Task Summary (Priority Order)
1. **TASK-1769905000** - Implement auto-sync roadmap state (implement, high)
2. **TASK-1769908000** - Make pre-execution research mandatory (implement, high)
3. **TASK-1769892006** - Documentation freshness audit (analyze, medium)
4. **TASK-1769895001** - Optimize LEGACY.md procedures (analyze, medium)
5. **TASK-1769903001** - Validate skill effectiveness (analyze, medium)
6. **TASK-1769899001** - Create skill selection guidance (implement, high)

## First Principles Review Preparation (Loop 50)

### Data to Gather
- **Runs to analyze:** 5 (run-0012 through run-0018)
- **Learnings to review:** 80+ captured
- **Improvements to assess:** 10 created, 2 applied
- **Integration points:** 5 verified (4 pass, 1 partial)

### Patterns to Identify
1. **Execution patterns:** Task completion rates, time estimates vs actual
2. **Outcome patterns:** Success criteria met, quality of deliverables
3. **Learning patterns:** Recurring themes, barriers, insights
4. **Decision patterns:** Quality of decisions, reversibility, outcomes

### Expected Outputs
- Review document: `knowledge/analysis/first-principles-review-50.md`
- Course correction decisions
- Improvement tasks for next 5 loops
- Updated STATE.yaml metrics

## Improvement Backlog Status
**Remaining:**
- High: 1 (IMP-1769903003: duplicate task detection)
- Medium: 6
- Low: 1

**Recently Applied:**
- IMP-1769903001 → TASK-1769905000 (in queue)
- IMP-1769903002 → TASK-1769908000 (in queue)

## Recent Task Velocity (Last 5 Completed)
- TASK-1769903002 - Validate autonomous workflow (14:20)
- TASK-1769902000 - Extract action items from learnings (13:45)
- TASK-1769899002 - Learning-to-improvement pipeline (12:50)
- TASK-1769902001 - First principles automation (12:30)
- TASK-1769899001 - Skill selection guidance (11:35)
- **Average completion time:** ~30 minutes
- **Success rate:** 100%

## System Health
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Planner | ✅ Healthy | Loop 49 completed, heartbeat updated |
| Executor | ✅ Idle | Ready for next task |
| Queue | ✅ Healthy | 6 tasks (above target) |
| Events | ✅ Healthy | 105 events tracked |
| Learnings | ✅ Healthy | 80+ captured |
| Improvements | ✅ Healthy | 10 created, 2 applied |
| Integration | ✅ Healthy | 4/5 points pass |

## Issues for Review
| Issue | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| ISSUE-001 | Low | Heartbeat staleness (fixed this loop) |
| ISSUE-002 | Low | Loop tracking discrepancy (metadata vs context) |

## Notes for Next Loop (50)
- **This is the first principles review loop**
- Review every 5 runs: 50, 55, 60, etc.
- Follow template: `.templates/reviews/first-principles-review.md.template`
- Document: patterns, course corrections, next priorities
- Update STATE.yaml improvement_metrics
