- **Implication:** Finite source exhausted, must transition to infinite source
- **Response:** ✅ Strategic shift validated (improvements → features)

**Discovery 4: Queue Depth Below Target - Action Required**
- **Finding:** 2 tasks remaining (below 3-5 target)
- **Evidence:** Current: 2, Target: 3-5, Gap: 1-3
- **Implication:** Must add 1-3 tasks this loop
- **Response:** 📝 Action plan established

**Discovery 5: Task Type Diversity Gap Identified**
- **Finding:** Current queue lacks features, operations, research
- **Evidence:** Current: 1 validation (50%), 1 infrastructure (50%)
- **Implication:** Need diverse task mix for sustainable pipeline
- **Response:** 📝 Prioritize operations and research tasks
