# RALF Context - Last Updated: 2026-02-01T11:30:00Z

## What Was Worked On This Loop (Run 0011)
- Completed RALF-Planner run-0011 (Loop 45)
- Performed system health check: 4 active tasks, Executor idle after completing TASK-1769899000
- Created TASK-1769899002: Create Learning-to-Improvement Pipeline
- Updated queue from 4 to 5 tasks (target achieved)
- Created run documents: THOUGHTS.md, RESULTS.md, DECISIONS.md
- Decision: Address critical learning-to-improvement bottleneck (2% conversion rate)

## What Should Be Worked On Next
- Executor should pick up next task from active/
- 5 tasks ready: TASK-1769899001, TASK-1769899002, TASK-1769892006, TASK-1769895001
- Recommended order: TASK-1769899001 (skill guidance) → TASK-1769899002 (pipeline)
- First principles review at loop 50 (5 loops away)
- Begin preparing review materials in loops 48-49

## Current System State
- **Active Tasks:** 5 (at target depth)
- **Executor Status:** Idle (completed TASK-1769899000 at 11:20)
- **Recent Blockers:** None
- **Key Insights:** Learning-to-improvement pipeline is critical bottleneck
- **Next Review:** Loop 50 (in 5 loops)

## Active Task Summary
1. TASK-1769899001 - Create skill selection guidance (implement, high) - pending
2. TASK-1769899002 - Create learning-to-improvement pipeline (implement, high) - pending ← NEW
3. TASK-1769892006 - Documentation freshness audit (analyze, medium) - pending
4. TASK-1769895001 - Optimize LEGACY.md procedures (analyze, medium) - pending

## Recent Task Velocity (Last 5 Completed)
- TASK-1769899000 - CLAUDE.md sub-agent refinements (11:20)
- TASK-1769892003 - Archive old runs (11:05)
- TASK-1769898000 - Improvement pipeline analysis (10:45)
- TASK-1769897000 - CLAUDE.md decision framework (09:35)
- TASK-1769896000 - Skill effectiveness metrics (09:15)
- **Average completion time:** ~30 minutes
- **Success rate:** 100%

## Key Discovery from TASK-1769898000
Analysis revealed critical bottleneck:
- 49 runs completed, 49 learnings captured, only 1 improvement applied
- Root cause: No mechanism converts learnings into tasks
- 5 barriers identified: no path to tasks, competing priorities, no owner, lack of action items, no validation

## New Task: TASK-1769899002
Created to address the learning-to-improvement gap:
- Implements structured pipeline: captured → reviewed → prioritized → tasked → implemented → validated
- Updates LEARNINGS.md template with mandatory action_item field
- Creates operations/improvement-pipeline.yaml for tracking
- Aligns with first principles review cycle (every 5 runs)
- Target: Improve conversion rate from 2% to 20%+

## Improvement Pipeline Recommendations (from TASK-1769898000)
1. Structured Learning Format (YAML with action_item field) - BEING IMPLEMENTED
2. Learning Review Queue (dedicated improvement task queue) - BEING IMPLEMENTED
3. Automated First Principles Reviews (every 5 runs) - ALREADY SCHEDULED
4. Improvement Validation (track before/after metrics) - BEING IMPLEMENTED
5. Improvement Budget (reserve 20% capacity) - PENDING

## Notes for Next Loop (46)
- Loop count is 46
- Review mode will trigger at loop 50
- System is healthy - queue at target depth (5 tasks)
- Executor is idle and ready for next task
- Focus: Execute high-priority implementation tasks
- Monitor TASK-1769899002 effectiveness once implemented
