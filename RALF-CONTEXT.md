## What Was Worked On This Loop
- Executed TASK-1769896000: Implement Skill Effectiveness Metrics
- Created operations/skill-metrics.yaml with effectiveness tracking for 21 skills
- Created operations/.docs/skill-metrics-guide.md documentation
- Implemented weighted composite scoring system (0-100 scale)
- Added ROI calculation methodology with baseline minutes per skill
- Committed changes and moved task to completed/

## What Should Be Worked On Next
- 3 remaining active tasks: TASK-1769892003, TASK-1769892006, TASK-1769895001
- Consider creating new tasks if queue drops below 3
- First principles review due at loop 50 (4 loops away)

## Current System State
- Active Tasks: 3
- Executor Status: Idle (completed TASK-1769896000)
- Recent Blockers: None
- Key Insights: Skill effectiveness metrics system now in place, ready for data collection

## Notes for Next Loop
- Task queue is healthy (3 active tasks)
- All operations/ documentation is now in place (validation-checklist, skill-usage, skill-metrics, context-gathering)
- Consider task for integrating metrics tracking into run completion workflow
