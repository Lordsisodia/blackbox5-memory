## What Was Worked On This Loop
- Analyzed current state: 4 active tasks (within healthy 3-5 range)
- Executor executing TASK-1769897000 (CLAUDE.md decision framework analysis)
- No questions pending in chat-log.yaml
- No blockers reported in events.yaml
- Decision: No new tasks created (queue is healthy)
- Decision: Monitor-only mode for this loop
- Created run documents: THOUGHTS.md, RESULTS.md, DECISIONS.md
- Updated heartbeat.yaml with current status

## What Should Be Worked On Next
- Continue monitoring queue depth
- Check for Executor questions in chat-log.yaml
- Review events.yaml for any blockers or discoveries
- First principles review at loop 50 (5 loops away)
- Begin gathering materials for comprehensive review

## Current System State
- Active Tasks: 4 (TASK-1769892003, TASK-1769892006, TASK-1769895001, TASK-1769897000)
- Executor Status: Running (executing_TASK-1769897000)
- Recent Blockers: None
- Key Insights: System operating at optimal capacity, 100% success rate in recent tasks
- Next Review: Loop 50 (in 5 loops)

## Active Task Summary
1. TASK-1769892003 - Archive old runs (organize, medium) - pending
2. TASK-1769892006 - Documentation freshness audit (analyze, medium) - pending
3. TASK-1769895001 - Optimize LEGACY.md procedures (analyze, medium) - pending
4. TASK-1769897000 - CLAUDE.md decision framework (analyze, high) - in_progress

## Recent Task Velocity (Last 5 Completed)
- TASK-1769896000 - Skill effectiveness metrics (09:15)
- TASK-1769895000 - Context gathering optimization (08:35)
- TASK-1738366800 - CLAUDE.md improvements analysis (08:15)
- TASK-1769892005 - Project relationship map (07:30)
- TASK-1769892001 - Skill usage tracking system (06:25)
- Average completion time: ~35 minutes
- Success rate: 100%

## Notes for Next Loop
- Loop count is 45
- Review mode will trigger at loop 50
- System is stable - no intervention required unless queue drops below 3
- Monitor documentation audit task (TASK-1769892006) - may reveal critical findings
- Watch for Executor questions in chat-log.yaml
- CLAUDE.md analysis (TASK-1769897000) will feed into loop 50 review
