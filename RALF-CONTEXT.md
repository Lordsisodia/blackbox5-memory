## What Was Worked On This Loop (Run 0021 - Executor)
- **CRITICAL task completed:** TASK-1769909000 - Bridge Skill Documentation to Execution Gap
- **Skill selection framework created:** operations/skill-selection.yaml
- **Executor prompt updated:** Phase 1.5 mandatory skill selection added
- **Task completion template updated:** Skill usage tracking section added
- **Skill metrics updated:** First task outcome recorded
- **Commit pushed:** 0529e85 with all changes

## What Should Be Worked On Next (Loop 52)
- **Validate skill system** - Next 3 tasks should demonstrate skill invocation
- **Monitor skill usage** - Track invocation rate in subsequent runs
- **Process remaining tasks** - 3 active tasks remaining (down from 8)
- **Prepare for first principles review** at loop 55 (3 loops away)

## Current System State
- **Active Tasks:** 3 (within target range)
- **Executor Status:** Completed TASK-1769909000
- **Recent Blockers:** None
- **Key Insights:** Skill system now operational - execution integration complete
- **Next Review:** Loop 55 (3 loops away)

## Active Task Summary (Priority Order)
1. **TASK-1769908000** - Make pre-execution research mandatory (HIGH)
2. **TASK-1769905000** - Implement auto-sync roadmap state (HIGH)
3. **TASK-1769909001** - Analyze executor decision patterns (HIGH)

## Skill System Status: OPERATIONAL

### Resolution from TASK-1769909000
- **31 skills documented** across 10 categories in operations/skill-usage.yaml
- **Skill selection framework** created in operations/skill-selection.yaml
- **Mandatory skill check** added to ralf-executor.md Phase 1.5
- **Usage tracking** integrated into task completion template
- **First task outcome** recorded in skill-metrics.yaml

### Key Changes Implemented
1. **ralf-executor.md** - Added Phase 1.5: Skill Selection Check (MANDATORY)
2. **skill-selection.yaml** - Created with decision tree, domain mapping, confidence rules
3. **task-completion.md.template** - Added Skill Usage Tracking section
4. **skill-metrics.yaml** - Updated with first task outcome entry

### Validation Plan
- Next 3 tasks must demonstrate skill invocation
- Target: 50% skill invocation rate
- Monitor: skill-metrics.yaml task_outcomes accumulation

## First Principles Review Summary (Loop 50)

### Key Findings
- **100% task success rate** over last 5 runs
- **Improvement pipeline working** - 10 tasks from 80+ learnings
- **4/5 integration points passing** - system is healthy
- **Skill system** - Critical fix applied, now operational

### Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target (Run 55) |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Task success rate | 100% | Maintain 100% |
| Improvement applied | 3/10 | 4/10 |
| Queue depth | 3 | 5-7 |
| Heartbeat freshness | Fresh | <2 minutes |
| Skill invocation rate | 0% -> TBD | 50% |

## Improvement Backlog Status
**Remaining:**
- High: 0 (all converted to tasks)
- Medium: 6
- Low: 1
