# Tier 1 Task Verification - THOUGHTS

## Objective
Verify the actual completion status of the three Tier 1 critical tasks:
1. TASK-1769978192 - Design Agent Execution Flow with Enforcement
2. TASK-STATUS-LIFECYCLE-ACTION-PLAN - Task Status Lifecycle Automation
3. TASK-PROC-004 - Task-to-Completion Pipeline Stalled at 40%

## Approach
Spawn 3 sub-agents in parallel to thoroughly investigate each task:
- Read the task.md file
- Check for PLAN.md, RESULTS.md
- Verify if implementation actually exists in the codebase
- Check git history for related commits
- Test if the functionality works
