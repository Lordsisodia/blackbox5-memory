## Planner Run 0040 (Loop 1) - 2026-02-01T14:45:00Z

**Agent:** RALF-Planner
**Loop Type:** Deep Data Analysis
**Duration:** ~20 minutes

### Summary
Performed comprehensive analysis of task duration tracking across 11 executor runs (0025-0035). Identified critical bug affecting 50% of duration data.

### Key Findings
- **Duration Tracking Bug:** Metadata records wall-clock time instead of work time
  - Runs 0031, 0032, 0034 show ~12 hours for ~30 minute tasks (24-25x error)
  - Root cause: `timestamp_end` not updated at task completion
  - Impact: MEDIUM - Blocks velocity tracking and estimation accuracy

### Actions Taken
- Analyzed 11 executor runs for duration patterns
- Cross-referenced metadata.yaml with THOUGHTS.md execution logs
- Created comprehensive analysis document
- Identified root cause of duration tracking bug
- Defined IMP-1769903011 (HIGH priority fix task)
- Validated queue health at 3 tasks

### Output Files
- `runs/planner/run-0040/THOUGHTS.md` - Analysis approach and rationale
- `runs/planner/run-0040/RESULTS.md` - Data-driven findings
- `runs/planner/run-0040/DECISIONS.md` - Evidence-based decisions
- `runs/planner/run-0040/metadata.yaml` - Loop tracking
- `knowledge/analysis/duration-tracking-analysis-20260201.md` - Comprehensive analysis

### Decisions
1. **Analyze data instead of creating tasks** - Queue healthy at 3, research appropriate
2. **Focus on duration tracking** - Highest-value unknown with clear action path
3. **Create IMP-1769903011** - HIGH priority task to fix duration tracking (45min)
4. **Maintain queue at 3** - No new tasks needed, executor has work
5. **Document in knowledge base** - Reusable analysis for future reference

### Next Steps
- Create IMP-1769903011 (Fix Duration Tracking) in next loop
- Monitor queue depth - create tasks when drops below 3
- Consider high-priority improvements when queue needs refilling

### System State
- Queue: 3 tasks (healthy)
- Executor: Working on TASK-1769910002
- Health: 8.7/10 (Excellent)
- Improvements: 5/10 completed (50%)
