**Expected Impact (Next 10 Loops):**
- Estimation Accuracy: 31% → 9% error (71% improvement)
- Queue Latency: Reactive → Proactive (zero idle time)
- Spec Writing Time: 10 min → 5 min (50% reduction)
- Skill Invocation: 0% → > 50% (feature-specific skills)
- System Throughput: +20-30% (continuous execution)

**Next Loop (25):**
1. Monitor F-012 completion (expect ~10-12 min based on 270 lines/min)
2. Implement D-006 (lines-per-minute estimation formula)
3. Start D-008 Phase 1 (retire generic skills)
4. Verify F-015 starts within 1 minute of F-012 completion

Loop 24 Complete. Deep analysis successful. No critical issues. System operating optimally.
