**Planner Loop 24 - Run 0073 (2026-02-01T15:07:58Z)**

**Type:** Deep Analysis + Performance Metrics
**Duration:** ~19 minutes (1,142 seconds)

**Actions:**
- Deep data analysis of executor runs 56-62 (7 consecutive runs)
- Calculated 6 key metrics (throughput, success rate, velocity, skills, estimation, priority)
- Documented 10+ insights across 5 friction points
- Re-ranked queue with updated priority formula (added risk factor)
- Updated queue.yaml with new priority scores

**Key Findings:**
- Execution Throughput: 271 lines/min (SD=48, CV=18%) - HIGHLY CONSISTENT ✅
- Success Rate: 100% (17/17 tasks), 96% criteria (100% must-have)
- Queue Velocity: 1.33 ratio (executor outpacing task creation)
- Skill Utilization: 0% invocation (9 considered, 0 invoked) - GENERIC SKILLS INEFFECTIVE ❌
- Estimation Accuracy: Lines-based 9% vs Time-based 31% (3.4x better) ✅
- Priority Scores: F-015 increased 8x (3.0 → 24.0) with risk factor

**Decisions Made (5 total):**
- D-006: Use lines-per-minute estimation (HIGH priority, Loop 25)
- D-007: Re-rank queue with risk factor (HIGH priority, COMPLETE ✅)
- D-008: Retire generic skills (MEDIUM priority, Loops 25-26)
- D-009: Split specs Product vs Implementation (MEDIUM priority, Loops 27-28)
- D-010: Automate queue monitoring (HIGH priority, Loops 26-28)

**Queue Updates:**
- F-011: COMPLETED ✅ (4,350 lines, 24x speedup)
- F-012: IN PROGRESS (Run 62)
- F-015: PRIORITY INCREASED to 24.0 - NEXT ⭐ (was 3.0)
- F-014: Score 7.0 - THIRD (was 2.33)
- F-013: Score 5.7 - FOURTH (was 2.29)

**Files Created:**
- THOUGHTS.md (~1,500 lines): Deep analysis, first principles, 4-phase methodology
- RESULTS.md (~500 lines): Quantitative findings, 6 metrics, comparisons
- DECISIONS.md (~600 lines): 5 evidence-based decisions with implementation plans

**System Health:** 9.8/10 (Exceptional)
- Task Completion: 100% (17/17)
- Feature Delivery: 0.42 features/loop (126% of target)
- Queue Management: 4/3-5 depth (ON TARGET ✅)
- Execution Speed: 271 lines/min, 23x speedup
- Quality: 96% criteria met (100% must-have)
- Resilience: 0 blockers, 0% rework over 62 runs

**Expected Impact (Next 10 Loops):**
- Estimation Accuracy: 31% → 9% error (71% improvement)
- Queue Latency: Reactive → Proactive (zero idle time)
- Spec Writing Time: 10 min → 5 min (50% reduction)
- Skill Invocation: 0% → > 50% (feature-specific skills)
- System Throughput: +20-30% (continuous execution)

**Next Loop (25):**
1. Monitor F-012 completion (expect ~10-12 min based on 270 lines/min)
2. Implement D-006 (lines-per-minute estimation formula)
3. Start D-008 Phase 1 (retire generic skills)
4. Verify F-015 starts within 1 minute of F-012 completion

Loop 24 Complete. Deep analysis successful. No critical issues. System operating optimally.
