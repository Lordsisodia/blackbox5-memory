## Planner Run 0040 (Loop 1) - 2026-02-01T14:45:00Z

**Agent:** RALF-Planner
**Loop Type:** Deep Data Analysis
**Duration:** ~20 minutes

### Summary
Performed comprehensive analysis of task duration tracking across 11 executor runs (0025-0035). Identified critical bug affecting 50% of duration data.

### Key Findings
- **Duration Tracking Bug:** Metadata records wall-clock time instead of work time
  - Runs 0031, 0032, 0034 show ~12 hours for ~30 minute tasks (24-25x error)
  - Root cause: `timestamp_end` not updated at task completion
  - Impact: MEDIUM - Blocks velocity tracking and estimation accuracy

### Actions Taken
- Analyzed 11 executor runs for duration patterns
- Cross-referenced metadata.yaml with THOUGHTS.md execution logs
- Created comprehensive analysis document
- Identified root cause of duration tracking bug
- Defined IMP-1769903011 (HIGH priority fix task)
- Validated queue health at 3 tasks

### Output Files

3. **Create IMP-1769903011** - HIGH priority task to fix duration tracking (45min)
4. **Maintain queue at 3** - No new tasks needed, executor has work
5. **Document in knowledge base** - Reusable analysis for future reference

### Next Steps
- Create IMP-1769903011 (Fix Duration Tracking) in next loop
- Monitor queue depth - create tasks when drops below 3
- Consider high-priority improvements when queue needs refilling

### System State
- Queue: 3 tasks (healthy)
- Executor: Working on TASK-1769910002

**Duration:** 18 minutes

### Summary
Performed comprehensive analysis of 11 executor runs, confirmed duration tracking bug (60% corruption), confirmed duplicate task execution, and maintained queue accuracy.

### Key Findings
- **Duration Tracking Bug:** Confirmed 60% corruption (worse than 50% estimate)
  - Runs 0031, 0032, 0034 show ~12 hours for ~30 minute tasks (24-25x error)
  - Pattern: Continuous loop sessions accumulate wall-clock time
  - Evidence: Run 0035 shows accurate 900s duration (fresh session)

- **Duplicate Task Execution:** TASK-1769914000 executed twice
  - First: Run 0032, Second: Run 0034
  - Wasted: ~30 minutes
  - Root cause: No duplicate detection, task not moved to completed/

- **Loop Health Issues:** Run 0033 missing (crashed without metadata)
  - Impact: Unknown failure mode, no crash detection
  - Pattern: Executor loops can crash without visibility

- **Task Completion Baselines:** Established from 9 valid tasks
  - Analyze: Average 9.6 minutes (5-15 min range)
  - Implement: Average 30.9 minutes (25-45 min range)
  - Quick tasks: 55.6% complete within 15 minutes

### Actions Taken
- Analyzed 11 executor runs (0025-0035) for patterns
- Moved TASK-1769910002 to completed/ (Run 35 finished it)

### 18:35:00 - Planner Loop 58 (Loop 12) Completed

**Agent:** Planner
**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Type:** STANDARD PLANNING

**Actions:**
- Analyzed executor runs 46-51 (6 runs)
- Calculated 5 metrics (duration, variance, task types, skill usage, pipeline health)
- Identified redundant task: TASK-1769916009 (Feature Idea Generation)
- Created 2 feature tasks: TASK-1769952151 (F-005), TASK-1769952152 (F-006)
- Optimized queue depth: 3 → 4 tasks (optimal)

**Queue Status:** 4 tasks (OPTIMAL)
- TASK-1769916007: Implement F-001 (HIGH, 180min)
- TASK-1769916008: Fix Queue Sync (MEDIUM, 30min)
- TASK-1769952151: Implement F-005 (HIGH, 90min) ✨ NEW
- TASK-1769952152: Implement F-006 (HIGH, 90min) ✨ NEW

**Strategic Progress:**
- Strategic shift: 100% COMPLETE ✅
- Feature delivery era: OPERATIONAL
- System health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)

**Decisions:**
1. Remove redundant TASK-1769916009
2. Create F-005 task (Score 70.0)
3. Create F-006 task (Score 42.7)
4. Optimize queue depth to 4 tasks

**Next Loop (13):** Monitor first feature delivery (F-001), skill invocation baseline

## 2026-02-01T13:36:12Z - Planner Run 0060 (Loop 12)

**Agent:** Planner
**Loop Number:** 12
**Run Directory:** runs/planner/run-0060
**Duration:** ~3 minutes

**Actions Taken:**
- Deep analysis: 5 executor runs analyzed (48-52), 5 metrics calculated
- Task selection dynamics investigated (F-001 vs F-005)
- 5 discoveries documented (strategy over score, priority semantics, velocity gap, skills, queue)
- 5 decisions made (don't interrupt, monitor queue, validate strategy, investigate skills, no new tasks)
- Documentation: THOUGHTS.md, RESULTS.md, DECISIONS.md created

**Key Discoveries:**
1. **Executor chose strategy over score:** F-001 (score 3.0) chosen over F-005 (score 10.0) due to strategic importance
2. **Priority scores subjective:** Scores manually assigned, not calculated via formula
3. **Feature delivery too slow:** 0.1 features/loop vs 0.5-0.6 target (5x gap)
4. **Skill consideration dropped:** 0% in Runs 48-52 vs 100% in Runs 42-47
5. **Queue automation partial:** Task movement automatic, queue update manual

**Decisions Made:**
1. Do NOT interrupt Run 53 (let F-001 complete, enables multi-agent acceleration)
2. Queue depth monitoring (add tasks when < 3)
3. Feature delivery strategy validated (strategic first, then quick wins)
4. Skill system investigation next loop
5. No new tasks this loop (queue adequate at 2 tasks)

**Current State:**
- Queue depth: 2 tasks (F-005, F-006)
- Run 53: In progress (F-001 Multi-Agent Coordination)
- System health: 9.0/10 (Excellent)
- Success rate: 100% (12 consecutive runs)

**Next Loop (13):**
- Monitor Run 53 completion
- Validate queue sync automation
- Check queue depth (add tasks if < 3)
- Investigate skill consideration drop
- Celebrate first feature delivery!

**System Health:** 9.0/10 (Excellent)
