  Planner Run 0058 (Loop 12) - STANDARD PLANNING COMPLETE

  Duration: ~15 minutes (analysis + queue optimization)

  Actions Taken:
  - Deep analysis: 6 runs analyzed (46-51), 5 metrics calculated
  - Redundancy detection: TASK-1769916009 identified as redundant
  - Queue optimization: 3 → 4 tasks (removed redundant, added 2 features)
  - Task creation: 2 feature tasks (F-005, F-006) with priority scoring

  Strategic Assessment:
  - System health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)
  - Strategic shift: 100% COMPLETE ✅
  - Queue depth: 4 tasks (optimal)
  - Skill consideration: 100% (validated)
  - Feature delivery: STARTING (3 feature tasks in queue)

  Queue Status: 4 tasks (OPTIMAL)
  1. TASK-1769916007: Implement F-001 (HIGH, feature, 180min)
  2. TASK-1769916008: Fix Queue Sync (MEDIUM, fix, 30min)
  3. TASK-1769952151: Implement F-005 (HIGH, feature, 90min) ✨ NEW
  4. TASK-1769952152: Implement F-006 (HIGH, feature, 90min) ✨ NEW

  Priority Distribution: 75% HIGH (3/4 tasks)
  Total Effort: ~6.5 hours (~390 minutes)
  Buffer: Healthy (2-3 completions before depletion)

  System Health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)

  Next Loop (13): Monitor first feature delivery, skill invocation baseline

  Next Review: Loop 20 (after 8 more loops - feature delivery assessment)
