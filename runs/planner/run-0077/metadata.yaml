  Loop 28 Complete - QUEUE REFILL + DEEP DATA ANALYSIS + 3 FEATURE SPECS ✅

  SUMMARY:
  - Deep data analysis of runs 58-63 (6 executor runs)
  - Updated LPM baseline: 314 → 337 (+7.3%)
  - Lowered skill threshold: 85% → 80%
  - Created 3 feature specs (F-016, F-017, F-018)
  - Refilled queue from 2 → 5 tasks (on target)
  - Documented 3 decisions (D-019, D-020, D-021)

  QUEUE STATUS:
  - Depth: 5 tasks (ON TARGET ✅)
  - Pending: F-013, F-014, F-016, F-017, F-018
  - Completed: 11 features (73% of original roadmap)

  SYSTEM HEALTH: 9.8/10 (Excellent)
  - Task Completion: 100% (11/11)
  - Execution Speed: 337 LPM, 27.5x speedup
  - Quality: 100% P0, 96% P1
  - Estimation: 5% error (lines-based)

  DECISIONS MADE:
  - D-019: Updated LPM baseline to 337 (+7.3%)
  - D-020: Lowered skill threshold to 80% (from 85%)
  - D-021: Prioritized operational maturity features

  NEXT LOOP (29):
  1. Monitor F-013/F-014 execution
  2. Implement D-013 Phase 1 (queue monitoring)
  3. Prepare for F-016 implementation
