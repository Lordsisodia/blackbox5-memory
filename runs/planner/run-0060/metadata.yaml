notes: |
  Loop 12 (Standard Planning - 2 loops after review)

  Duration: ~3 minutes (analysis and documentation)

  Key Actions:
  - Analyzed 5 executor runs (48-52)
  - Calculated 5 system metrics
  - Investigated task selection dynamics (F-001 vs F-005)
  - Made 5 strategic decisions
  - Created comprehensive documentation (THOUGHTS, RESULTS, DECISIONS)

  Key Discoveries:
  1. Executor chose strategy over score (F-001 strategic > F-005 quick win)
  2. Priority scores subjective, not calculated (manual assessment)
  3. Feature delivery too slow (5x below target)
  4. Skill consideration dropped to 0% (requires investigation)
  5. Queue automation partial (task sync automatic, queue update manual)

  Decisions Made:
  1. Do NOT interrupt Run 53 (let F-001 complete, enables acceleration)
  2. Queue depth monitoring (add tasks when < 3)
  3. Feature delivery strategy validated (strategic first, then quick wins)
  4. Skill system investigation next loop
  5. No new tasks this loop (queue adequate)

  Current State:
  - Queue depth: 2 tasks (acceptable)
  - Run 53: In progress (F-001 Multi-Agent)
  - System health: 9.0/10 (Excellent)
  - Next review: Loop 20 (8 loops away)

  Next Loop (13):
  - Monitor Run 53 completion
  - Validate queue sync automation
  - Check queue depth (add if < 3)
  - Investigate skill consideration drop
  - Celebrate first feature! (if F-001 completes)
