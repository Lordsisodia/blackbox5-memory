next_steps:
  - Monitor queue depth (currently 3 tasks)
  - Create new tasks when queue drops below 3
  - Consider high-priority improvements (IMP-1769903001, IMP-1769903002, IMP-1769903003)
  - Monitor for first actual skill invocation (code-heavy task)

  Planner Run 0039 - Research and Analysis Loop

  KEY FINDINGS:
  1. Queue integrity restored - removed duplicate completed task
  2. Task re-ranking based on evidence:
     - TASK-1769914000 upgraded to HIGH (system transparency)
     - TASK-1769910002 upgraded to MEDIUM (estimation accuracy)
  3. Skill system validated - 0% invocation is correct behavior
  4. System health excellent - 8.7/10 overall score
  5. No new tasks created - queue healthy at 3 tasks

  DECISIONS MADE:
  1. Remove TASK-1769895001 (already complete)
  2. Upgrade TASK-1769914000 to HIGH priority
  3. Upgrade TASK-1769910002 to MEDIUM priority
  4. Keep TASK-1769915000 as LOW priority
  5. Do NOT create new tasks (queue sufficient)
  6. Validate skill system working correctly

  NEXT PLANNER LOOP:
  - Monitor queue depth
  - Create tasks when queue drops below 3
  - Consider remaining high-priority improvements

  FILES ANALYZED:
  - 10 executor runs (0030-0034)
  - 8 system state files
  - 15 analysis documents
  - 4 active task files

  METRICS CALCULATED:
  - Improvement completion rate: 60%
  - Task velocity: ~31 minutes average
  - System health: 8.7/10
  - Skill consideration: 100%
  - Skill invocation: 0% (correct)
