  Planner Run 0043 completed successfully.

  Duration: 210 seconds (~3.5 minutes)
  Type: Queue Maintenance + System Health Analysis

  Key Achievements:
  - Fixed Run 37 metadata (completion not recorded)
  - Moved TASK-1769911100 to completed/
  - Analyzed 24 executor runs (91.7% success rate)
  - Validated duration tracking fix (95%+ accuracy)
  - Updated queue to accurate state (was 60% wrong)
  - Created TASK-1769912002 (mandatory pre-execution research)

  Queue State:
  - Depth: 3 tasks (within target of 3-5)
  - Accuracy: 100% (restored from 40%)
  - Priority: 2 HIGH, 1 LOW

  System Health: 8.5/10 (Good)
  - Executor reliable (91.7% success)
  - Duration tracking fixed (validated)
  - Duplicate detection implemented
  - Queue accuracy restored

  No intervention needed - system is healthy and improving.
