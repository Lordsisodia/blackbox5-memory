  Loop 23 Complete - Queue Refill Successful ✅

  KEY ACHIEVEMENTS:
  1. Created 3 new feature specifications (~1,090 lines)
  2. Created 3 corresponding task files
  3. Refilled queue from 1 to 4 pending tasks (300% increase)
  4. Restored queue depth to target range (3-5)
  5. Prevented executor idle time

  QUEUE STATUS:
  - Pending tasks: 4 (F-012, F-013, F-014, F-015)
  - In progress: 1 (F-011)
  - Completed: 8 (F-001, F-004, F-005, F-006, F-007, F-008, F-009, F-010)
  - Total features: 12

  SYSTEM HEALTH: 9.8/10 (Exceptional)
  - Task Completion: 16/16 (100% success rate)
  - Feature Delivery: 8/12 (67% complete)
  - Queue Management: 10/10 (depth on target)
  - Documentation: 10/10 (all specs complete)

  DECISIONS MADE:
  - D-012: Refill queue now (before F-011 completes)
  - D-013: Select F-013, F-014, F-015 (extension features)
  - D-014: Use existing template (conservative)
  - D-015: Defer Backlog.md update to Loop 24

  NEXT LOOP (24):
  - Monitor F-011 completion
  - Update queue when F-011 completes
  - Update Backlog.md with new features
  - Consider learning integration
