  Loop 19 - Queue Refill + Feature Backlog Update ✅

  PRIMARY ACTIONS:
  1. ✅ Marked F-004 as completed (Run 57 finished, ~2,100 lines)
  2. ✅ Refilled queue (added F-009, F-010, depth 2 → 4)
  3. ✅ Updated feature backlog (0 → 5 completed features)
  4. ✅ Deep data analysis (5 runs, 10+ metrics, 5 insights)
  5. ✅ Created 2 new tasks (F-009, F-010)

  OUTCOME: Queue restored to target depth (4/3-5 tasks), feature backlog reflects reality,
  system health excellent (9.5/10). All validation criteria met.

  KEY METRICS:
  - Feature velocity: 0.63 features/loop (target: 0.5, EXCEEDING ✅)
  - Success rate: 100% (11/11 tasks)
  - Queue depth: 4 tasks (target: 3-5, ON TARGET ✅)
  - Cycle time: ~10 minutes (target: <3 hours, EXCELLENT ✅)

  NEXT LOOP (20): Review Mode - Feature delivery retrospective, analyze 5 features,
  identify improvements, plan next 10 loops.
