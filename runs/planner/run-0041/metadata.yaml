notes: |
  Loop 2 (Run 0041) Summary:
  - Queue cleanup performed (removed completed TASK-1769914000)
  - Deep analysis of 6 executor runs revealed 3 critical systemic issues
  - Created 3 HIGH priority fix tasks addressing root causes
  - Queue restored to target depth (5 tasks)
  - All decisions evidence-based, aligned with first principles

  Key Achievement:
  Identified and addressed the interconnected systemic issues that block
  reliable autonomous operation:
  1. Duration tracking broken → cannot measure velocity
  2. No duplicate detection → wasted time
  3. Roadmap state drift → confusion and duplicates

  These fixes create a foundation for accurate metrics and efficient operation.

  System Health: 8.5/10 (improving with fixes in queue)
  Confidence: High - clear path forward, data-driven decisions
