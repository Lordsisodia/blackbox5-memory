notes: |
  Completed TASK-1769909001 analysis. Key finding: 0% skill usage across 6 runs.
  Root cause identified as lack of execution integration, not documentation.
  Provided 4 concrete recommendations for executor prompt improvement.
  Established baseline metrics for skill system recovery validation.
