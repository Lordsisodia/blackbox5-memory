  Planner Run 0078 (Loop 29) Complete ✅

  ACTIONS TAKEN:
  1. Deep data analysis of runs 63-64 (2 features, 5,920 lines, 1,027 seconds)
  2. Updated LPM baseline: 337 → 346 (+2.7%)
  3. Documented LPM acceleration trend: 271 → 314 → 337 → 346 (+15.9% over 4 cycles)
  4. Updated queue.yaml with F-014 completion (depth 4, on target)
  5. Created 3 documentation files (THOUGHTS.md, RESULTS.md, DECISIONS.md)
  6. Updated RALF-CONTEXT.md with loop learnings

  DECISIONS MADE:
  - D-022: Update LPM baseline to 346 (+2.7%)
  - D-023: Maintain current queue depth (no refill needed)
  - D-024: Document LPM acceleration trend and compounding efficiency hypothesis

  CURRENT QUEUE (4 tasks - ON TARGET ✅):
  1. TASK-1769958230: F-013 (Code Review) - IN PROGRESS (Run 65)
  2. TASK-1738375000: F-016 (CLI Tooling) - PENDING (Score 8.5)
  3. TASK-1738375002: F-018 (Health Monitoring) - PENDING (Score 9.0)
  4. TASK-1738375001: F-017 (Audit Logging) - PENDING (Score 7.8)

  COMPLETED TASKS: 12
  - F-004 (Testing), F-008 (Dashboard), F-009 (Skill Marketplace)
  - F-010 (Knowledge Base), F-011 (GitHub Integration), F-012 (API Gateway)
  - F-015 (Configuration Management), F-014 (Performance Monitoring)
  - Plus 4 earlier features

  System Health: 9.9/10 (Exceptional)
  - Task Completion: 12/12 (100% success rate)
  - Feature Delivery: 12/15 (80% complete)
  - Queue Management: 10/10 (depth 4, on target)
  - Execution Speed: 346 lines/min, 25x speedup (IMPROVING +2.7%)
  - Quality: 100% P0, 100% P1 criteria met

  Key Insights (Loop 29 Deep Analysis):
  1. LPM acceleration sustaining: 4 consecutive cycles of improvement
  2. Improvement rate slowing: 15.9% → 7.3% → 2.7% (approaching asymptote)
  3. Hypothesis: Compounding efficiency from pattern recognition + template reuse
  4. Prediction: LPM will plateau around 350-400 LPM

  Next Loop (30):
  1. Monitor F-013 completion (expect ~6.7 min at 346 LPM)
  2. Verify queue depth after F-013 (expect 3)
  3. Assess if refill needed (if depth < 3)
  4. Document LPM for Run 65 (continue trend analysis)
