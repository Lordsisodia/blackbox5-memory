discoveries:
  - "Root cause: Integration gap - function existed but was never called by executor"
  - "Queue sync automation now working: 3 completed tasks removed in test run"
  - "Manual queue sync no longer required (~5 min/loop saved)"

next_steps:
  - "Monitor next 3 executor runs (53-55) to verify automatic queue sync works end-to-end"
  - "Remove manual queue sync from planner loop once verified"
  - "Update task specification template with integration testing step"

notes: |
  Task completed successfully. Queue sync automation now operational.
  
  Root Cause: Hypothesis A confirmed - function existed but was not integrated
  into executor's post-task completion workflow.
  
  Solution: Updated ralf-executor.md Step 3.2 to call sync_all_on_task_completion()
  before moving task file to completed/.
  
  Impact:
  - Tasks now automatically removed from queue.yaml on completion
  - No more manual queue sync required (~5 min/loop saved)
  - Single source of truth maintained automatically
  
  Testing: Verified queue sync works (3 tasks removed in test run)
  
  Documentation: Created operations/.docs/queue-sync-fix.md (328 lines)
  
  Commit: c286a9c
  
  Lessons Learned:
  1. Test automation immediately after creation
  2. Document all integration points
  3. Use named arguments for CLI tools (future improvement)
  
  Next: Monitor runs 53-55 to verify end-to-end automation.
