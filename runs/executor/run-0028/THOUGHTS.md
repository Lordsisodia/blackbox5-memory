## Task
TASK-1769913000: Create Task Acceptance Criteria Template

## Objective
Create a comprehensive task acceptance criteria template to improve task scope clarity and prevent confusion during execution.

## Approach

### Step 1: Research and Analysis
- Read the improvement file (IMP-1769903009) to understand full requirements
- Analyzed existing task templates to understand current structure
- Reviewed task specification template to plan integration

### Step 2: Template Design
Created acceptance criteria template with:
- Definition of Done section with functional, quality, and process criteria
- Task-type specific criteria (implement, fix, refactor, analyze, organize)
- Verification steps section
- Sign-off section for accountability

### Step 3: Integration
- Updated task-specification.md.template with enhanced acceptance criteria section
- Added SMART criteria guidance
- Included Must-Have/Should-Have/Nice-to-Have priority levels
- Added verification method section

### Step 4: Documentation
Created comprehensive guide covering:
- Why acceptance criteria matter (based on learnings analysis)
- How to use the template
- Writing good criteria (SMART principles)
- Examples by task type
- Common pitfalls to avoid
- Integration with workflow

### Step 5: Backlog Update
- Marked IMP-1769903009 as completed in improvement-backlog.yaml
- Added completion timestamp and reference to this task

## Execution Log

1. Read IMP-1769903009 improvement file
2. Read existing task-specification.md.template
3. Read task-completion.md.template for context
4. Read improvement-backlog.yaml
5. Created task-acceptance-criteria.md.template
6. Updated task-specification.md.template with enhanced acceptance criteria
7. Created task-acceptance-criteria-guide.md documentation
8. Updated improvement-backlog.yaml to mark IMP-1769903009 complete
9. Updated task file status and moved to completed/

## Challenges & Resolution

**Challenge:** Balancing comprehensiveness with usability
- *Resolution:* Created tiered criteria (Must/Should/Nice) so tasks can be appropriately scoped

**Challenge:** Making template applicable to all task types
- *Resolution:* Added task-type specific sections that can be selected based on task category

**Challenge:** Ensuring criteria are actually testable
- *Resolution:* Included verification method section and SMART criteria guidance

## Key Decisions

1. **Priority Tiers:** Used Must/Should/Nice hierarchy to allow flexible scoping
2. **Task Types:** Created specific criteria for each major task type
3. **Integration:** Enhanced existing template rather than replacing it
4. **Documentation:** Created separate guide rather than inline comments
