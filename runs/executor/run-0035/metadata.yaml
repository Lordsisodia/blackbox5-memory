notes: |
  Task completion time analysis completed successfully.
  Key findings:
  - 9 valid tasks analyzed (7 excluded due to loop restart issues)
  - Baselines established: analyze (5-25 min), implement (25-45 min), security (50-70 min)
  - Estimation guidelines created with priority and complexity multipliers
  - Critical issues identified: duplicate task execution, loop health problems
