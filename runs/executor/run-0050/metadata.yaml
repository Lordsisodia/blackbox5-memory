  TASK-1769916005: Create System Metrics Dashboard - COMPLETED

  Duration: ~46 minutes (2780 seconds)
  Estimated: 45 minutes
  Status: Within estimate

  All acceptance criteria met:
  - Metrics dashboard created with 5 metric categories
  - Auto-updates on task completion (integrated with roadmap_sync)
  - Usage guide documented (comprehensive guide with 10 sections)
  - Historical tracking implemented (last 10 runs, last 24 hours)
  - Readable by Planner and Executor

  Key accomplishments:
  - Centralized metrics visibility for system health
  - Data-driven planning enabled
  - Real-time monitoring capability
  - Automatic metric updates on task completion
  - Comprehensive documentation for users

  Integration:
  - metrics_updater.py created (500+ lines)
  - Integrated with roadmap_sync.py::sync_all_on_task_completion()
  - Non-blocking design (logs errors but doesn't fail)
  - CLI interface for manual testing

  Current system state:
  - System health: 9.0/10 (excellent)
  - Task velocity: 1.3 tasks/hour
  - Queue depth: 2 tasks (slightly low)
  - Skill consideration: 100%
  - Skill invocation: 0% (appropriate for these tasks)
  - Feature delivery: 0 completed, 4 planned

  Next actions:
  - Planner: Add 1-3 tasks to queue (depth is 1 after this task)
  - Monitor: Skill invocation rate over next 10 runs
  - Review: Metrics dashboard data for Loop 50 planning
