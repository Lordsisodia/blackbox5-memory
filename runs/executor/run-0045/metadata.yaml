notes: |
  Critical bug fix completed. Added Step 2.5 (Skill Checking - MANDATORY) to executor prompt.
  This unlocks 13 runs of skill system investment (Runs 22-35) that was being underutilized.

  Expected outcomes:
  - 100% skill consideration rate (every task checks for skills)
  - 10-30% skill invocation rate (appropriate tasks use skills)
  - Better code quality (skill guidance for complex tasks)
  - Faster execution (proven patterns from skills)

  Changes:
  - Executor prompt: +65 lines (Step 2.5)
  - THOUGHTS.md template: +9 lines (skill section + validation)
  - All additive changes, no breaking changes
  - High reversibility (can remove Step 2.5 if issues arise)

  Duration: 80 seconds (1.3 minutes)
  Estimated: 20 minutes
  Under budget: 18.7 minutes saved
