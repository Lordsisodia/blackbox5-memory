# TASK-1738334891: Archive Duplicate Documentation Files

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Created:** 2026-01-31T05:54:51Z
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Project:** RALF-CORE
**Generated By:** gap-analysis

## Objective

Identify and archive duplicate documentation files that exist in multiple locations across the blackbox5 codebase.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All duplicate documentation files identified and catalogued
- [ ] Canonical locations determined for each duplicate set
- [ ] Duplicate files moved to archive directory
- [ ] No broken references remaining
- [ ] Documentation is cleaner and easier to navigate

## Context

### Source Analysis
- **Gap Analysis:** PLAN-006 (Remove Redundant Code) identified documentation duplicates as remaining work
- **Initial Audit:** Found ~20+ sets of duplicate markdown files with identical MD5 hashes
- **Sample Duplicates Found:**
  - `iflytek-astron-agent-ANALYSIS.md` exists in 3 locations
  - `NEW-FRAMEWORKS-DISCOVERY.md` exists in 3 locations
  - Similar pattern across research and reference docs

### Duplicate Pattern
The duplicates appear to follow this pattern:
1. `1-docs/01-theory/05-research/[FILE].md` (canonical?)
2. `1-docs/development/reference/research/[FILE].md` (duplicate)
3. `2-engine/.autonomous/prompt-progression/research/[FILE].md` (duplicate)

## Approach

### Phase 1: Quick Flow - QUICK-SPEC

**Goal:** Archive duplicate documentation files

**Files to analyze:**
- All duplicate markdown files (identified by MD5 hash)

**Risk Level:** LOW - Moving files to archive, not deleting

**Rollback Strategy:** Keep archive directory structure for easy restoration

### Phase 2: DEV-STORY

1. Identify all duplicate files using MD5 hash analysis
2. Determine canonical location (prefer `1-docs/01-theory/` for theory docs)
3. Create archive directory: `~/.blackbox5/archived/duplicate-docs/`
4. Move duplicates to archive preserving directory structure
5. Verify no broken links or references

### Phase 3: CODE-REVIEW

- Verify all duplicates moved
- Check no broken references in remaining docs
- Confirm archive is properly organized

## Risk Level

**LOW** - Files are being archived, not deleted. Can be easily restored.

## Rollback Strategy

Archive directory maintains full directory structure, so files can be moved back to original locations if needed.
