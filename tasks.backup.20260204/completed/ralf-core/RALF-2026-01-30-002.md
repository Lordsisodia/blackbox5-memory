# RALF-2026-01-30-002: Add Dry-Run Mode to Shell Scripts

**Task ID:** RALF-2026-01-30-002
**Status:** completed
**Type:** improvement
**Priority:** high
**Component:** shell

---

## Goal

Add `--dry-run` support to all shell scripts in `engine/shell/` to enable safe testing of changes.

## Background

From the testing strategy analysis, shell scripts need a dry-run mode that:
- Shows what would be executed without doing it
- Validates paths and prerequisites
- Reports potential issues
- Returns exit code 0 if validation passes

This is critical for RALF to safely test script changes.

## Scripts to Update

| Script | Priority | Dry-Run Behavior |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| `ralf-loop.sh` | Critical | Show what would be checked/executed |
| `telemetry.sh` | High | Show what telemetry would be recorded |
| `validate.sh` | High | Show validation checks |
| `task` | Medium | Show task operations |
| `test-run.sh` | Medium | Show test execution plan |

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Common Library

Create `engine/lib/dry_run.sh` with shared dry-run utilities:
- `dry_run_echo()` - Print what would happen
- `dry_run_exec()` - Skip execution in dry-run mode
- `dry_run_check()` - Validate prerequisites

### 2. Update Each Script

Add to each script:
```bash
DRY_RUN=false

while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
    case $1 in
        --dry-run)
            DRY_RUN=true
            shift
            ;;
        *)
            shift
            ;;
    esac
done

# Example usage
if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == true ]]; then
    echo "[DRY-RUN] Would execute: some_command"
else
    some_command
fi
```

### 3. Create Test Script

Create `engine/shell/test-dry-run.sh` that:
- Runs all scripts with `--dry-run`
- Validates exit codes
- Reports any failures

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `lib/dry_run.sh` created with common utilities
- [ ] All 6 scripts support `--dry-run` flag
- [ ] `test-dry-run.sh` validates all scripts
- [ ] Documentation updated in `skills/run-initialization.md`
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed

## Notes

- Start with `ralf-loop.sh` as it's the most critical
- Use consistent output format: `[DRY-RUN] Would: <action>`
- Ensure dry-run mode never modifies state
- Consider adding `--verbose` flag for detailed output
