# TASK-1769807395: Fix Skills System Critical Issues

**Status:** pending
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2026-01-31T04:03:15Z
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Project:** RALF-CORE
**Generated By:** goal-cascade

## Objective

Fix the skills system by consolidating 3 different implementations into a single canonical system, enabling agents to properly attach and use skills.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Single skills/ directory with no duplicates
- [ ] SkillManager loads 50+ skills successfully
- [ ] All agents can attach skills (5/5 agents)
- [ ] All path references updated
- [ ] Tests pass

## Context

### Source: Goal Cascade (PLAN-001)
From `/Users/shaansisodia/.blackbox5/6-roadmap/03-planned/PLAN-001-fix-skills-system/`:

**Problem:**
- 3 different skills systems exist:
  - `skills-cap/` (OLD SYSTEM - 101 skills)
  - `.skills-new/` (NEW SYSTEM - converted)
  - `skills/` (UNCLEAR)
- 33 duplicate skills (68 unique from 101 total)
- Path mismatches prevent skill attachment
- SkillManager can't find skills
- 0/5 agents can attach skills

**Impact:** Agents cannot attach skills, crippling agent capabilities

**Solution:** 4-Phase Consolidation
1. **Audit** (2 hours) - Analyze all 3 systems, choose canonical one
2. **Consolidation** (4-6 hours) - Archive old systems, keep one
3. **Path Updates** (2-3 hours) - Update all references
4. **Testing** (1-2 hours) - Verify SkillManager works

### Files to Change
- `skill_manager.py` - Update skills path
- `base_agent.py` - Update SKILLS_BASE
- All skill references - Find and replace

## Approach

### Phase 1: QUICK-SPEC
1. Analyze current skills directory structure
2. Identify canonical skills system to keep
3. Map all path changes needed

### Phase 2: DEV-STORY
1. Archive old skills systems
2. Consolidate to single directory
3. Update all path references
4. Test SkillManager loading

### Phase 3: CODE-REVIEW
1. Verify skills load correctly
2. Test agent skill attachment
3. Check no duplicate paths

## Risk Level

MEDIUM - Changes core agent capability loading, but rollback is simple (restore from git)

## Rollback Strategy

Git revert all changes if tests fail or agents cannot load skills

---

## Execution

**Path Selected:** Quick Flow (clear scope, well-defined solution)
**Estimated:** 1-2 days

## Completion

**Completed:** 2026-01-31T04:03:15Z
**Status:** SKIPPED - DUPLICATE
**Reason:** Task was already completed as TASK-20260130-001 on 2026-01-30
**Run Folder:** N/A (duplicate task)
**Agent:** Agent-2.3

### Research Findings

The PLAN-001 roadmap task is based on outdated information:
- The 3 skills systems mentioned (skills-cap, .skills-new, skills) do not exist in current codebase
- Skills system was already fixed on 2026-01-30 by TASK-20260130-001
- 25 Tier 2 skills now loading successfully
- All BMAD skills available (9 skills)

### Actual Results from TASK-20260130-001

- Converted 11 skills to Agent Skills Standard format with YAML frontmatter
- Fixed SkillManager cache manager path
- PLAN-002 and PLAN-003 unblocked

### Recommendation

Update PLAN-001 in roadmap to reflect actual completion, or mark as completed.
