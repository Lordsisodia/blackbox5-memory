**Status:** in_progress
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Created:** 2026-01-30T13:00:00Z
**Agent:** Agent-2.3

## Objective

Consolidate 3 conflicting skills systems into 1 working system. Fix skill loading so agents can attach skills.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Only 1 skills/ directory exists
- [ ] 0 duplicate skills
- [ ] SkillManager loads 50+ skills successfully
- [ ] All skill paths valid and accessible
- [ ] Tests pass

## Context

The skills system has 3 implementations causing chaos:
- `skills-cap/` - OLD SYSTEM (101 skills, 33 duplicates)
- `.skills-new/` - NEW SYSTEM (converted/cleaned)
- `skills/` - UNCLEAR

**Impact:** Agents cannot attach skills, crippling capabilities.

**Blocks:**
- PLAN-002: Fix YAML Agent Loading
- PLAN-003: Implement Planning Agent

## Approach

1. **Audit** (30 min) - Count skills in each system
2. **Decision** (30 min) - Choose which system to keep
3. **Consolidation** (2-4 hours) - Archive old, rename new
4. **Path Updates** (1 hour) - Update all references
5. **Testing** (1 hour) - Verify everything works

## Risk Level

MEDIUM - Keeping archived systems for rollback

## Rollback Strategy

Archived systems kept for 1 week. Can restore by reversing archive/rename operations.
