# TASK-1769783044: Create Goals System for Human-Directed Work

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2026-01-30T14:24:04Z
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Project:** RALF-CORE
**Generated By:** gap-analysis

## Objective

Create a goals system that enables human-directed work alongside RALF's autonomous task generation. This fills a critical gap where humans cannot currently specify high-level objectives for RALF to achieve.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Goals directory structure created with templates
- [ ] Goal format defined with cascade-to-tasks capability
- [ ] Active goal file created with current RALF priorities
- [ ] Task generation logic updated to check goals first
- [ ] Documentation explaining how to create goals

## Context

### Gap Identified
The autonomous task generation system has four analysis methods:
1. Telemetry-driven (reactive)
2. First-principles (proactive)
3. Gap analysis (benchmarking)
4. Goal cascade (human-directed)

However, the goal cascade method cannot function because there is no `goals/` directory and no format for defining goals.

### Source Analysis
- **Gap:** No `goals/` directory exists (checked 2026-01-30)
- **Impact:** Human cannot direct RALF toward specific objectives
- **Current behavior:** RALF only works autonomously when no tasks exist
- **Desired behavior:** RALF checks goals first, then falls back to autonomous generation

## Approach

1. Create goals directory structure
2. Define goal file format (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
3. Create template for new goals
4. Create first active goal: "RALF v2.3 Integration Release"
5. Update autonomous task generation to prioritize goals
6. Document the goals system

## Risk Level

LOW - This is an additive feature that doesn't modify existing functionality. It only adds a new check at the start of autonomous task generation.

## Rollback Strategy

1. Remove `goals/` directory
2. Remove goal-checking logic from task generation
3. System falls back to existing behavior (pure autonomous generation)

**Decisions Recorded:** 0 (no architectural decisions needed)

### Results

All success criteria met:

1. ✅ Goals directory structure created:
   - `active/` - contains GOAL-001 (RALF v2.3 Integration Release)
   - `completed/` - ready for completed goals
   - `templates/` - contains goal-template.md

2. ✅ Goal format defined with cascade-to-tasks capability
   - YAML frontmatter for metadata
   - Sub-goals section with "→ Creates: TASK-XXXX" pattern

3. ✅ Active goal file created:
   - GOAL-001-ralf-v23-integration-release.md
   - Contains 8 sub-goals for v2.3 integration
   - 7 of 8 sub-goals already completed

4. ✅ Task generation logic updated:
   - ralf.md contains goal checking logic (lines 331-346)
   - "FIRST: Check for Active Goals" section
   - Goal-derived tasks get 90+ priority override

5. ✅ Documentation created:
   - `1-docs/02-implementation/07-task-management/design/GOALS-SYSTEM.md`
   - Complete with examples, best practices, anti-patterns
   - Integration guide for ralf.md
