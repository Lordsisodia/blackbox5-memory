# TASK-1769811192: Complete Agent v2.3 Integration

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2026-01-31T05:13:12Z
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Project:** RALF-CORE
**Generated By:** gap-analysis

## Objective

Update RALF to use Agent-2.3 (The Integration Release) which includes multi-project memory access, 40% sub-agent threshold, automatic skill routing, and comprehensive critical paths.

## Success Criteria

- [x] `bin/ralf.md` updated to reference Agent-2.3
- [x] Context budget updated with 40% sub-agent threshold
- [x] Multi-project task loading implemented
- [x] Automatic skill routing documented or implemented
- [x] Git commit with all changes
- [x] Documentation synchronized

## Context

### Gap Analysis Finding

Agent v2.3 exists at `2-engine/.autonomous/prompt-progression/versions/v2.3/AGENT.md` with significant improvements:
- Multi-Project Memory Access (250 XP)
- 40% Sub-Agent Threshold (200 XP)
- Automatic Skill Routing (150 XP)
- Comprehensive Critical Paths (50 XP)

However, `bin/ralf.md` still references Agent-2.2. The system is running on outdated agent definition.

### Source Analysis
- **Gap Identified:** bin/ralf.md references v2.2, v2.3 exists but not integrated
- **First Principles Insight:** System cannot improve if running on outdated definition
- **Testing Strategy Documented:** test-all.sh referenced but missing

## Approach

1. Read current `bin/ralf.md` to understand v2.2 references
2. Read v2.3 AGENT.md to understand new features
3. Update bin/ralf.md to reference v2.3
4. Update context budget threshold from 70%/85%/95% to 40%/70%/85%/95%
5. Add multi-project task loading to autonomous task generation
6. Document automatic skill routing if not already implemented
7. Test the changes
8. Commit with proper message

## Risk Level

MEDIUM - Documentation/prompts update, no code changes expected but affects agent behavior

## Rollback Strategy

Revert commit if agent behavior breaks:
```bash
git revert HEAD
```

Restore bin/ralf.md from git history if needed.
