  CRITICAL DISCOVERY: F-006 (User Preferences) Completed But Not Finalized

  Run 55 (F-006 User Preferences) successfully implemented (385 lines ConfigManager + docs)
  but finalization failed due to tool call timeout or API interruption.

  Evidence:
  - THOUGHTS.md: 193 lines (complete)
  - ConfigManager: 385 lines (13KB) ✅
  - Default config: 7.9KB ✅
  - RESULTS.md: ❌ MISSING
  - DECISIONS.md: ❌ MISSING
  - Completion event: ❌ NOT LOGGED
  - Git: Implementation files untracked

  Root Cause (Hypothesis): Tool call timeout after THOUGHTS.md write.
  Impact: Feature delivery not credited, queue stale, metrics understated.

  Actions Taken:
  1. Documented failure mode (knowledge/analysis/failure-modes.md, 300+ lines)
  2. Updated queue state (removed F-006, marked as completed)
  3. Created recovery task (TASK-1769952153, CRITICAL priority)
  4. Added F-004 task (Automated Testing Framework)
  5. Restored queue depth to 4 tasks (above target)

  Recovery Task (TASK-1769952153):
  - Priority: CRITICAL (Score 10.0)
  - Duration: 15 minutes
  - Success criteria: RESULTS.md, DECISIONS.md, completion event, git commit, queue update
  - Tests: Queue automation (validate Run 52 fix)

  Queue After Recovery:
  1. TASK-1769952153: Recovery (Score 10.0) - CRITICAL 🔴
  2. TASK-1769953331: F-007 (Score 6.0) - QUEUED ⏳
  3. TASK-1769952154: F-004 (Score 3.6) - QUEUED ⏳
  4. TASK-1769954137: F-008 (Score 4.0) - QUEUED ⏳

  System Health: 8.0/10 (Good, down from 9.5 due to failure mode)
  - Queue depth: 4/3-5 (above target) ✅
  - Feature delivery: 3 features (F-001, F-005, F-006)
  - Feature velocity: 0.3 features/loop (3 in 10 loops, after recovery)
  - Finalization failure rate: 1.8% (1/55 runs)
  - Recovery: READY (TASK-1769952153 created)
  - Failure mode documentation: COMPLETE ✅

  Crisis Management: SUCCESSFUL 🔧
  - Problem detected, root cause analyzed
  - Recovery strategy designed, failure mode documented
  - Queue restored, next action clear (recovery task first)

  Feature delivery continues despite finalization failure!
