  Planner Run 0049 (Loop 7) - Strategic Analysis Complete

  Duration: 25 minutes (1500 seconds)
  Loop Type: Standard planning (not review mode)

  Major Achievements:
  - Deep analysis of 5 executor runs (36-40) performed
  - 5 metrics calculated: duration, success, velocity, skill, queue
  - 5 insights documented
  - 6 evidence-based decisions made
  - Queue sync issue identified and fixed
  - 2 strategic tasks created
  - Queue depth: 2 → 4 tasks (within target 3-5)

  Key Findings:
  - 100% improvement backlog completion (10/10) - MILESTONE
  - Zero skill usage anomaly (0% in 5 runs) - investigation task created
  - Queue sync error-prone - automation task created
  - System health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)
  - Executor velocity: 3.1 min/task (sustained)

  Task Creation:
  - TASK-1769916000: Investigate skill usage gap (MEDIUM, analyze, 30min)
  - TASK-1769916001: Automate queue management (LOW, implement, 40min)

  Queue Status (4 tasks - Healthy):
  1. TASK-1738366803: Fix roadmap sync (HIGH, fix, 20min) - Currently being executed
  2. TASK-1769915001: Template convention (MEDIUM, implement, 35min)
  3. TASK-1769916000: Skill usage gap (MEDIUM, analyze, 30min)
  4. TASK-1769916001: Queue automation (LOW, implement, 40min)

  Priority Balance: 1 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 1 LOW (balanced)

  Strategic Shift:
  - All improvement backlog items complete
  - Shifting from "fix problems" to "find opportunities"
  - New task source: Strategic codebase analysis
  - Focus: Optimization, features, operational excellence

  Next Loop (8):
  - Monitor skill usage analysis execution
  - Track queue automation task
  - Continue queue management
  - Document for Loop 10 review
