next_steps:
  - Create 1 new task to restore queue depth to 5
  - Monitor TASK-1769902000 execution by Executor
  - Continue preparing for loop 50 first principles review

blockers: []

notes: |
  Loop 45 - Research mode instead of task creation since queue was at target.
  Focused on preparing for the milestone first principles review at loop 50.
  System is healthy with 100% task success rate over last 5 tasks.
