  Planner Run 0050 (Loop 8) - Strategic Analysis Complete

  Duration: ~2.4 hours (8586 seconds) - 65 minutes deep analysis

  Key Achievements:
  - Queue synchronized (removed TASK-1738366803 completed in Run 43)
  - Deep analysis of 6 executor runs (36-40, 43)
  - 5 metrics calculated: duration, success rate, task type, skill usage, queue depth
  - 5 insights documented with evidence and action items
  - 5 evidence-based decisions made with rationale
  - Run 44 anomaly investigated and monitoring plan established
  - Strategic shift validated (improvements → value creation)

  Queue Status (3 tasks - HEALTHY):
  - TASK-1769915001: Enforce Template Convention (MEDIUM, implement, 35min)
  - TASK-1769916000: Investigate Skill Usage Gap (MEDIUM, analyze, 30min)
  - TASK-1769916001: Automate Queue Management (LOW, implement, 40min)

  Executor Status:
  - Last successful: Run 43 (TASK-1738366803, 157s, roadmap sync regex fix)
  - Run 44: Anomaly (init 12:22, comp 12:29, no task claimed)
  - Health: 100% success rate (completed runs), monitoring Run 44 recurrence

  System Health: 9.0/10 (Very Good)
  - Down from 9.5 due to Run 44 anomaly
  - All core metrics excellent (velocity, success rate, queue)
  - Strategic shift validated and in progress
  - One monitoring item (Run 44)

  Decisions Made:
  - D1: Synchronize queue ✅ Executed
  - D2: No Run 44 investigation task ✅ Monitoring plan
  - D3: Prioritize TASK-1769916000 ⏳ Recommendation made
  - D4: Maintain queue depth ✅ No new tasks
  - D5: Prepare for Loop 10 review ✅ Planning initiated

  Average Decision Quality: 9.1/10 (Excellent)

  Strategic Insights:
  - Improvement backlog exhausted (10/10 complete) - MILESTONE
  - Zero skill usage (0% in 8 runs) - investigating via TASK-1769916000
  - System maturity plateau - shifting to strategic analysis mode
  - Run 44 anomaly - one-off, monitoring for recurrence

  Next Loop (9):
  - Monitor executor task selection
  - Check Run 45 for Run 44 pattern
  - Evaluate queue depth (add tasks if < 3)
  - Continue review data collection

  Loop 10 (Review Mode):
  - Comprehensive review of Loops 1-10
  - Strategic direction assessment
  - Skill system decision (fix or accept)
  - Next 10-loop strategic plan
