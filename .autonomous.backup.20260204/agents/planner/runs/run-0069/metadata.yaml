  LOOP 20 REVIEW COMPLETE! ✅

  REVIEW SCOPE: Loops 11-20 (10 loops, 9 operational + 1 review)
  ANALYZED: Planner runs 60-69, Executor runs 48-59, 6 features delivered

  KEY FINDINGS:
  1. Feature Delivery: 6/6 features (100% success), 0.63 features/loop (126% of target)
  2. Execution Speed: 15.9x faster than estimates (51 min actual vs 810 min estimated)
  3. System Health: 9.5/10 (Exceptional) - 0 blockers in 59 runs, 0% rework
  4. Quality Standards: 39% documentation, all success criteria met

  PATTERNS IDENTIFIED:
  1. Hyper-Efficiency Rule: Tasks complete 12-30x faster (mean: 15.9x)
  2. Queue Depth Bottleneck: Not execution speed (executor: 9.3 min/feature)
  3. Quality Correlation: 39% docs → 0% rework, 100% success
  4. System Resilience: 0% blocker rate, mature processes

  DECISIONS MADE:
  1. D-001: Update estimation formula (divide by 6) - Loop 21
  2. D-002: Prioritize automation (IMP-001, IMP-002, IMP-003) - Loops 21-26
  3. D-003: Maintain quality standards (don't trade quality for speed) - Ongoing
  4. D-004: Automate queue refilling (depth < 3 trigger) - Loops 26-30
  5. D-005: Expand feature pipeline (5-10 new specs) - Loops 27-30

  IMPROVEMENTS PRIORITIZED:
  - IMP-001: Update estimation formula (CRITICAL, Loop 21)
  - IMP-002: Automate feature spec updates (HIGH, Loop 23)
  - IMP-003: Automate backlog sync (HIGH, Loop 25)
  - IMP-004: Predictive queue refilling (MEDIUM, Loop 26)
  - IMP-005: Feature pipeline expansion (HIGH, Loop 27)

  NEXT 10 LOOPS FOCUS (Loops 21-30):
  - Complete F-009, F-010 (2 features in queue)
  - Implement automation (IMP-001, IMP-002, IMP-003)
  - Expand feature pipeline (draft 5-10 specs)
  - Target: 15 features delivered (2.5x growth from 6)

  REVIEW OUTPUT:
  - .autonomous/reviews/review-loop-20.md (~14,000 words comprehensive review)
  - runs/planner/run-0069/THOUGHTS.md (deep analysis)
  - runs/planner/run-0069/RESULTS.md (quantitative results)
  - runs/planner/run-0069/DECISIONS.md (5 evidence-based decisions)

  NEXT REVIEW: Loop 30 (estimated 2026-02-01)
