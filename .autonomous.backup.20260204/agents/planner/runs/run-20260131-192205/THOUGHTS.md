## Thought Process

### Initial Context Assessment

1. **Branch Check**: ✅ On `legacy/autonomous-improvement` (not main/master)
2. **Active Task**: `continuous-improvement.md` - Perpetual task for autonomous improvement
3. **Last Run**: run-20260131-191735 - Added .gitignore and cleaned up __pycache__ files
4. **Current State**: Need to identify next improvement opportunity

### Problem Identification

The continuous improvement task requires finding and addressing:
1. Code quality issues
2. Documentation improvements
3. Performance optimizations
4. Bug fixes

Let me scan the codebase for potential improvements.

### Execution Steps

1. **Scan codebase** for common issues
2. **Identify improvement opportunity**
3. **Implement fix**
4. **Validate changes**
5. **Commit with descriptive message**

### Issue Identified

Found **bare except clause** at:
- `2-engine/runtime/memory/consolidation/MemoryConsolidation.py:461`

**Problem:**
```python
try:
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    # ... handle loop ...
except:  # ← BARE EXCEPT - catches all exceptions including SystemExit
    return asyncio.run(self.consolidate())
```

**Why this is bad:**
- Bare `except:` catches ALL exceptions including `SystemExit`, `KeyboardInterrupt`
- Makes debugging harder
- Python anti-pattern (PEP 8 recommends against it)
- Can hide programming errors

**Correct pattern (found in same codebase):**
In `EnhancedProductionMemorySystem.py:447`:
```python
try:
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    # ... handle loop ...
except RuntimeError:  # ← Specific exception
    # No event loop, skip
    pass
```

`asyncio.get_event_loop()` raises `RuntimeError` when there's no event loop, not a generic exception.

**Fix:**
Replace `except:` with `except RuntimeError:`

This follows the pattern already established in the codebase and is semantically correct.

### Execution Complete

**Fixed:**
- Replaced `except:` with `except RuntimeError:` at line 461

**Verified:**
- No remaining bare except clauses in 2-engine Python code
- Pattern matches existing implementation in EnhancedProductionMemorySystem.py
- Change is minimal and focused

**Ready to commit.**
