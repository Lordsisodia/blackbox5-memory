tasks_created:
  - TASK-1769911000
  - TASK-1769911001

next_steps:
  - Executor should prioritize TASK-1769911000 (HIGH priority)
  - Monitor for first actual skill invocation after threshold adjustment
  - Continue processing improvement backlog

notes: |
  Loop 56 - Normal planning mode (review was Loop 55).
  Focus on restoring queue depth and addressing skill system threshold issue.
  System health is excellent across all components.
