decisions:
  - id: "DEC-20260131-001"
    timestamp: "2026-01-31T04:30:00Z"
    phase: "QUICK-SPEC"
    context: "Skills system audit to determine canonical directory per PLAN-001 from roadmap"

    options_considered:
      - id: "OPT-001"
        description: "Use skills/ as canonical system (NO CHANGE)"
        location: "~/.blackbox5/2-engine/.autonomous/skills/"
        pros:
          - "Already referenced by skill_router.py (line 166)"
          - "Contains 10 BMAD skill files"
          - "Clean, standard directory structure"
          - "Well-documented with README.md"
          - "All skills are accessible and properly configured"
        cons:
          - "None identified"
      - id: "OPT-002"
        description: "Consolidate from skills-cap/"
        location: "Not found in filesystem"
        pros:
          - "N/A - directory does not exist"
        cons:
          - "Directory not present in filesystem"
      - id: "OPT-003"
        description: "Consolidate from .skills-new/"
        location: "Not found in filesystem"
        pros:
          - "N/A - directory does not exist"
        cons:
          - "Directory not present in filesystem"

    selected_option: "OPT-001"
    rationale: "The skills/ directory is already the canonical system. The alleged 'duplicate skills systems' (skills-cap/, .skills-new/) do not exist in the filesystem. PLAN-001 from the roadmap appears to be based on outdated information."

    assumptions:
      - id: "ASM-001"
        statement: "skills-cap/ and .skills-new directories do not exist in the filesystem"
        risk_level: "LOW"
        verification_method: "Filesystem search confirmed absence of these directories"
        status: "VERIFIED"
      - id: "ASM-002"
        statement: "skill_router.py correctly references skills/ directory"
        risk_level: "LOW"
        verification_method: "Code review of skill_router.py line 166"
        status: "VERIFIED"

    reversibility: "HIGH"
    rollback_complexity: "No rollback needed - this is a documentation decision confirming existing state"
    rollback_steps:
      - "N/A - no changes made"

    verification:
      required: true
      verified_by: "Agent-2.3"
      verified_at: "2026-01-31T04:30:00Z"
      criteria:
        - "Confirmed skills/ directory exists at ~/.blackbox5/2-engine/.autonomous/skills/"
        - "Confirmed 10 BMAD skill files present"
        - "Confirmed skill_router.py references correct path"
        - "Confirmed skills-cap/ and .skills-new do not exist"
        - "All skills are accessible via skill_router.py"

    status: "VERIFIED"
