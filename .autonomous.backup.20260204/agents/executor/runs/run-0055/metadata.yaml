discoveries:
  - "Configuration system enables RALF personalization without code changes"
  - "Three-layer fallback strategy ensures robustness (user config → default config → built-in)"
  - "YAML is the right choice for configuration (human-readable, supports comments)"
  - "Skill invocation threshold now configurable (was hardcoded at 70%)"
  - "Feature delivery framework validated (3rd feature delivered successfully)"

notes: |
  Feature F-006 (User Preference & Configuration System) completed successfully.

  Summary:
  - Third feature delivered (after F-001, F-005)
  - ~1,450 lines delivered (320 spec + 370 code + 280 config + 480 docs)
  - Duration: 536 seconds (~9 minutes) - under 90-minute estimate
  - All must-haves completed (8/8)
  - Most should-haves completed (2/3)

  Key Deliverables:
  1. ConfigManager library (load, validate, get, set, save, reload)
  2. Default configuration with all values documented
  3. Executor integration (skill threshold configurable)
  4. Comprehensive user guide (480 lines)

  Feature Delivery Metrics:
  - Features completed: 3 (F-001, F-005, F-006)
  - Total lines: 4,928 lines (1,990 + 1,498 + 1,450)
  - Feature velocity: 0.2 features/loop (3 features / 15 loops)
  - Quick wins delivered: 3/3 (F-001, F-005, F-006 all 90-min features)

  Strategic Impact:
  Transforms RALF from "one-size-fits-all" to flexible, user-controlled platform.
  Enables personalization without code changes, lowers barrier to adoption.

  Framework Validation:
  Feature delivery framework validated and operational (3rd successful feature).
