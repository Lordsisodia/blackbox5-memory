notes: |
  Investigation complete - Critical bug identified and fix task created.

  Key Finding:
  - Skill selection framework exists (skill-selection.yaml)
  - Executor prompt missing Phase 1.5 skill checking workflow
  - Result: 0% skill invocation despite significant investment

  Root Cause:
  - skill-selection.yaml says "MUST check before Phase 2"
  - Executor prompt doesn't include this requirement
  - Executors have no instruction to check for skills

  Impact:
  - 13 runs of skill system work not being utilized
  - Complex tasks missing skill guidance (Runs 37-39)
  - Quality issues that skills might have prevented

  Fix:
  - TASK-1769916002 created (HIGH priority, 20 min effort)
  - Add Phase 1.5 to executor prompt between Phase 1 and Phase 2
  - Expected: 100% consideration rate, 10-30% invocation rate

  Status: ✅ Bug confirmed, fix task ready for execution
