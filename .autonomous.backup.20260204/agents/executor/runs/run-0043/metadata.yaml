notes: |
  Task description stated that 4 HIGH priority improvements were marked "pending"
  but they were actually "completed" in the improvement-backlog.yaml. This suggests
  they were manually fixed after the task was created. The sync library bug was
  still real and needed fixing.

  The regex pattern fix ensures that future task completions will automatically
  update the improvement backlog without manual intervention.
