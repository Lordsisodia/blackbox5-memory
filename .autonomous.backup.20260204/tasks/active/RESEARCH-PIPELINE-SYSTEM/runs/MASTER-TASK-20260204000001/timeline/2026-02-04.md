# Timeline: 2026-02-04 - Research Pipeline System Initiated

## Events

### 00:00 - Epic Created
- MASTER-TASK-20260204000001 created
- Vision: Multi-agent research pipeline for autonomous pattern discovery
- 4-agent architecture: Scout, Analyst, Planner, Executor

### 00:15 - BB5 Infrastructure Research
- Analyzed existing BB5 autonomous systems
- Identified: RALF, BMAD, Redis agents, Orchestrator
- Found: 22+ skills, task registry, communication protocols
- Conclusion: Extensive infrastructure exists to leverage

### 00:30 - Architecture Decisions
- 4-agent pipeline (not 2 or 6+)
- Leverage existing BB5 infrastructure
- 4 human approval gates
- Neo4j for concept graph
- Continuous + triggered hybrid
- File-based + Redis hybrid communication

### 00:45 - Master Task Documentation
- Created MASTER-TASK-20260204000001.md
- Defined 10 subtasks
- Created run folder with THOUGHTS/DECISIONS/ASSUMPTIONS/LEARNINGS/RESULTS
- Created first subtask: Design Pipeline Architecture

## Decisions Made

1. Use 4 specialized agents
2. Leverage BB5 Redis, orchestrator, skills
3. Human gates at 4 points
4. Neo4j for concept relationships
5. Scout/Analyst continuous, Planner/Executor triggered

## Blockers

None. Ready to proceed with architecture design.

## Next Steps

1. TASK-20260204000002: Design Pipeline Architecture
2. Define agent interfaces
3. Create data flow diagrams
4. Specify communication protocol
