# Timeline: 2026-02-04 - Research Pipeline System Initiated

## Summary

Initial creation of the Research Pipeline System (RAPS) master task and supporting documentation. System designed to automatically discover, rank, plan, and execute research tasks using BB5 infrastructure.

## Activities

### 01:30 - Master Task Created
- Created TASK-RESEARCH-PIPELINE-001.md
- Defined 4-agent pipeline architecture
- Specified hybrid communication (Redis + Files)
- Documented 5 implementation phases

### 01:35 - Sub-Tasks Created
- TASK-001-A: Research BB5 Infrastructure (in_progress)
- TASK-001-B: Design Agent Interfaces (pending)

### 01:40 - Run Documentation Created
- THOUGHTS.md - Design rationale and philosophy
- DECISIONS.md - 7 key architecture decisions
- ASSUMPTIONS.md - Technical and business assumptions
- LEARNINGS.md - Patterns and recommendations
- RESULTS.md - Progress tracking

### 01:45 - BB5 Infrastructure Researched
- Identified reusable components:
  - SupervisorAgent for task creation
  - AutonomousAgent for execution
  - RedisCoordinator for communication
  - TaskRegistry for persistence
  - 22+ BMAD skills for intelligence
- Documented integration strategy

## Decisions Made

1. **4-Agent Pipeline** - Scout, Analyst, Planner, Executor
2. **Hybrid Communication** - Redis (speed) + Files (audit)
3. **Neo4j Graph** - For concept relationships
4. **Continuous + Triggered** - Scout/Analyst always on, Planner/Executor on-demand
5. **4 Human Gates** - Research, Integration, Task Plan, Implementation
6. **Leverage BB5** - Reuse existing infrastructure
7. **One Task At A Time** - Executor constraint for quality

## Key Insights

- BB5 has extensive infrastructure we can reuse
- Dual-RALF's file-based approach complements Redis
- Specialized agents > generalist agents
- Compute efficiency through execution pattern variation

## Blockers

None. Ready to proceed with Phase 0 (Research & Design).

## Next Actions

1. Complete TASK-001-A (BB5 infrastructure research)
2. Begin TASK-001-B (Agent interface design)
3. Set up Neo4j instance
4. Configure Redis schema
5. Build Scout agent MVP
