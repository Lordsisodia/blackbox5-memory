# Skill Selection Framework
# BlackBox5 - Operations
#
# Purpose: Guide skill selection during task execution to bridge the gap
#          between documented skills and actual usage.
#
# Usage: Executors MUST check this file before starting Phase 2 (Execution)
#        of any task. Follow the decision tree to determine if a skill
#        should be invoked.
#
# Integration: Works alongside skill-usage.yaml and skill-metrics.yaml

# ============================================================================
# Quick Decision Tree
# ============================================================================
#
# START: Read task file completely
#   |
#   v
# Check skill-usage.yaml for applicable skills
#   |
#   +---> Match found with >70% confidence? ---> YES ---> Invoke skill
#   |                                           |
#   |                                           NO
#   |                                           |
#   +---> No match or <70% confidence? ---------> Proceed with standard execution
#   |
#   v
# Document decision in THOUGHTS.md
#   |
#   v
# END: Continue with Phase 2 (Execution)

# ============================================================================
# Auto-Trigger Rules (MANDATORY)
# ============================================================================
#
# These rules MUST be checked before every task execution.
# If ANY rule matches, the corresponding skill MUST be evaluated.

  step_2: "Check auto_trigger_rules for matching conditions"
  step_3: "Check skill-usage.yaml for skills with matching trigger_keywords"
  step_4: "Match task type against domain_mapping above"
  step_5: "Calculate confidence based on keyword overlap and task context"
  step_6: "If confidence >= threshold, invoke the skill"
  step_7: "If confidence < threshold, proceed with standard execution"

# Validation Checklist
# ============================================================================

validation:
  before_execution:

    - "Calculated confidence for any matches"
    - "Documented decision in THOUGHTS.md"

# ============================================================================
# Examples
# ============================================================================

examples:
  - scenario: "Task: Create PRD for user authentication"
    skill_selected: "bmad-pm"
    confidence: 95
    rationale: "Task explicitly mentions PRD creation, matches bmad-pm triggers"
    auto_trigger: "ATR-005"

  - scenario: "Task: How should we architect the caching layer?"
    skill_selected: "superintelligence-protocol"
    confidence: 90
    rationale: "Question format 'How should we' + architecture = superintelligence-protocol"
    auto_trigger: "ATR-004"

  - scenario: "Task: Fix typo in README"
    skill_selected: "None"
    confidence: N/A
    rationale: "Simple task, no skill adds value, below complexity threshold"
    auto_trigger: "None"

  - scenario: "Task: Implement n8n workflow for data sync"
    skill_selected: "bmad-dev"
    confidence: 85
    rationale: "Implementation task with clear requirements, bmad-dev appropriate"
    auto_trigger: "ATR-001"
