# Skill Usage Tracking System
# BlackBox5 - Operations
#
# Purpose: Track skill usage patterns, effectiveness, and identify optimization opportunities
# Updated: Manually after each skill invocation (automated tracking planned for future)
#
# Usage:
#   - Record each skill invocation in the usage_log section
#   - Update aggregate stats periodically
#   - Review monthly for optimization opportunities
