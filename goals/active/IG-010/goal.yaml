# Goal IG-010: Implement World-Class Hook System for BB5

**Status:** in_progress
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Created:** 2026-02-06
**Target Completion:** 2026-02-28

---

## Objective

Design, implement, and deploy the most intelligent, comprehensive hook system for BlackBox5 agents. Our hooks should be industry-leading, combining best practices from 19+ GitHub repositories with custom BB5-specific innovations.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All critical hooks implemented and tested
- [ ] Hooks follow best practices from multi-agent-ralph-loop, juno-code, SWE-agent
- [ ] BB5-specific custom hooks address unique workflow needs
- [ ] Agents use hooks intelligently with minimal manual intervention
- [ ] Hook system is documented, maintainable, and extensible
- [ ] 90%+ task completion automation via hooks
- [ ] Zero data loss or corruption through hook validation

---

## Why This Matters

Hooks are the nervous system of BB5. They:
- Automate tedious manual updates
- Prevent errors before they happen
- Ensure data consistency across all systems
- Enable intelligent agent orchestration
- Capture learnings and insights automatically
- Validate task completion rigorously

Without world-class hooks, BB5 remains a manual, error-prone system.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Best Practices First** - Study what others have done, adopt the best
2. **BB5 Customization** - Add hooks specific to our goal/plan/task hierarchy
3. **Intelligent Automation** - Hooks should make agents smarter, not just automate
4. **Fail-Safe Design** - Hooks should never lose data or break workflows
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start simple, iterate to sophistication

## Research Sources

- multi-agent-ralph-loop (83+ hooks)
- juno-code (lifecycle hooks)
- SWE-agent (Python class-based hooks)
- smart-ralph (plugin hooks)
- Claudeman (API integration hooks)
- BB5 current implementation (10+ hooks)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Lifecycle Hooks (Week 1)
- SessionStart (enhanced)
- SessionEnd (comprehensive)
- Stop (checkpoint)

### Phase 2: Task Management Hooks (Week 2)
- pre-task-complete validation
- post-task-complete sync
- post-goal-progress calculation

### Phase 3: Quality & Safety Hooks (Week 3)
- git-safety-guard
- quality-gates
- context-warning

### Phase 4: Intelligence Hooks (Week 4)
- smart-memory-search
- decision-extractor
- verification-subagent

## Related Goals

- IG-006: Agent Execution Flow (complementary)
- IG-008: Hindsight Memory (uses hooks for retention)
- IG-009: Hooks Framework (this goal supersedes and expands)

---

## Notes

This goal was created after comprehensive research of 19 GitHub repositories and 150+ hook opportunities. The implementation will be documented in associated plans and tasks.
