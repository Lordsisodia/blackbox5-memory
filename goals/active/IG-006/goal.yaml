notes: |
  Major restructuring in progress. Key decisions:
  - Keep .autonomous/ as dot-folder (sorts to top, hidden)
  - Organize by agent type (planner, executor, architect)
  - Move tasks to root (you wanted them there)
  - Move goals to root (project-level, not agent-level)

  Challenges encountered:
  - Had to consolidate three task systems into one
  - Runs were scattered across 5 locations
  - Empty folders everywhere

  Architecture principles established:
  1. Runtime data in .autonomous/
  2. Project management at root
  3. Clear separation by agent type
  4. No duplicate systems
