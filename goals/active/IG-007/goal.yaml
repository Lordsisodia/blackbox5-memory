notes: |
  This goal establishes a meta-level improvement system where the AI
  continuously improves not just the code, but how the code is organized
  and documented.

  Key principles:
  1. AI agents analyze structure and suggest improvements
  2. First principles validate all suggestions
  3. Iterative execution with feedback loops
  4. Documentation evolves with architecture
  5. Continuous, not one-time cleanup

  Success means the architecture gets better every week without
  explicit human direction.
