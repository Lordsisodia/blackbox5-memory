    type: goal_created
    description: "Goal created based on extensive research into Hindsight memory architecture and Two Buffers theory"
    progress_delta: 0
    notes: "Research phase complete. Ready to move to planning phase. Key insight: BB5 has strong functional memory (Buffer 1) but lacks subjective memory (Buffer 2) and synchronization."

    type: research_completed
    description: "Completed comprehensive research on Hindsight, Mem0, Zep, Letta, memU memory systems"
    progress_delta: 5
    notes: "Created 8 research documents in knowledge/research/agent-memory-systems/"
