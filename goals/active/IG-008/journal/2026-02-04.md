# Journal Entry: 2026-02-04

## Completed Today

### 1. Proper Architecture Setup
Created the complete BB5 goal/plan/task hierarchy for Hindsight memory implementation:

**Goal:** IG-008 with 6 sub-goals (SG-008-1 through SG-008-6)
**Plan:** PLAN-HINDSIGHT-001 with proper metadata.yaml and epic.md
**Tasks:** 6 tasks (TASK-HINDSIGHT-001 through TASK-HINDSIGHT-006)
**Symlinks:** All bidirectional links properly configured

### 2. Integration Analysis
Researched and documented how Hindsight memory integrates with existing BB5 systems:

**Key Findings:**
- Agent Swarm Memory Architecture already has 3-layer hierarchy
- Hindsight adds a 4th persistent layer between swarm coordination and agent runs
- Two Buffers Theory maps directly to Hindsight's 4 networks:
  - Buffer 1 (Functional) = World + Experience networks
  - Buffer 2 (Subjective) = Opinion + Observation networks

**Integration Points Identified:**
1. Swarm Orchestrator - Use RECALL for pattern detection
2. SessionStart Hook - Inject relevant memories as Layer 4
3. Navigation System - Add `bb5 memory:` commands
4. Architecture Evolution - Memory-driven improvement loop

### 3. Dependencies Mapped

**Blocking:**
- IG-006 (Restructure) at 75% - must complete before rollout
- Project Memory Reorganization - templates must fit new structure

**Parallel:**
- IG-007 (Architecture Evolution)
- Navigation System
- Agent Swarm Memory

### 4. Documentation Created
- INTEGRATION.md - Complete integration guide
- Updated epic.md with related systems
- Updated TASK-MEMORY-001 to mark research phase complete

## Key Decisions

1. **Extend, Don't Replace:** Hindsight memory will coexist with existing THOUGHTS.md/DECISIONS.md
2. **Layer 2 Position:** Hindsight sits between Swarm Coordination (Layer 1) and Agent Runs (Layer 3)
3. **RETAIN First:** Start with automated extraction from existing runs before building new templates

## Open Questions

1. Embedding strategy: text-embedding-3-small vs fine-tuned
2. Retention policy: Forever or expire old memories?
3. Privacy: Encryption for sensitive memories?
4. Multi-project: Share memories across projects?

## Next Steps

1. Wait for IG-006 completion before creating templates
2. Design embedding pipeline with cost estimates
3. Prototype RETAIN on existing runs
4. Test RECALL integration with SessionStart hook

## Metrics

- Goal progress: 10% (architecture complete, implementation pending)
- Research: 100% complete
- Planning: 100% complete
- Ready to start Phase 1 when IG-006 completes
