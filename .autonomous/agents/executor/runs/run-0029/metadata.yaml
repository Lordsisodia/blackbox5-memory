discoveries:
  - "Success rate: 82.8% (24/29 runs completed)"
  - "Skill invocation rate: 0% (monitoring after threshold change)"
  - "Commit compliance: 75% (improvement opportunity)"
  - "Phase 1.5 compliance: 100% (post-fix)"

notes: |
  Dashboard created successfully with 20 runs of historical data.
  Key insight: 0% skill usage but 100% Phase 1.5 compliance indicates
  the skill checking is working but threshold was blocking until run-0027.
