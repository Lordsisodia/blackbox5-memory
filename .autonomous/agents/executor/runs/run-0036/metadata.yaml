notes: |
  Duration tracking fix implemented and tested.
  ✓ Duration within expected range
  
  Success Criteria Met:
  - Executor updates timestamp_end at actual task completion ✓
  - Duration calculated as completion_time - start_time ✓
  - Duration validation added (> 4 hours warning) ✓
  - Tested with bash syntax and workflow validation ✓
  - Documented fix in knowledge base ✓
  
  Files Modified:
  - 2-engine/.autonomous/prompts/system/executor/variations/v2-legacy-based.md
  - knowledge/analysis/duration-tracking-fix-20260201.md
  
  Impact: Enables accurate velocity tracking, trend analysis, and capacity planning.
  Unblocks: TASK-1769910002 (Analyze task completion time trends)
