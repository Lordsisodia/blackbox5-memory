discoveries:
  - "80% skill threshold is blocking invocations (runs 0022, 0024 had 70-75% confidence)"
  - "LEGACY.md describes different system than RALF-Executor uses"
  - "Generic quality gates don't match task-specific needs"

questions_asked: []

next_steps:
  - "Consider implementing P0 recommendation: lower threshold to 70%"
  - "Update ralf-executor.md to reference quality-gates.yaml"
  - "Track skill invocation rate over next 5 runs"

blockers: []

notes: |
  Task completed successfully. Identified 5 friction points and created
  task-specific quality gates. Key recommendation: lower skill invocation
  threshold from 80% to 70% based on evidence from runs 0022 and 0024.
