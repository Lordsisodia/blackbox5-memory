# Results - TASK-1769896000

**Task:** TASK-1769896000
**Status:** completed

## What Was Done

Created a comprehensive skill effectiveness metrics tracking system to measure which skills deliver the best results and guide skill selection decisions.

### Files Created

1. **operations/skill-metrics.yaml**
   - Effectiveness metrics for all 21 skills
   - Weighted composite scoring (0-100 scale)
   - ROI calculation methodology
   - Task outcomes log section
   - Category performance analysis
   - Skill selection recommendations
   - Quality rating scale (1-5)

2. **operations/.docs/skill-metrics-guide.md**
   - Effectiveness score calculation explanation
   - How to record task outcomes
   - ROI calculation methodology
   - Weekly review process
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Example workflows

## Validation

- [x] Skill metrics YAML created with all 21 skills
- [x] Effectiveness tracking schema defined with 5 components
- [x] ROI calculation methodology documented
- [x] Documentation created with usage guide
- [x] All success criteria met

## Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| operations/skill-metrics.yaml | Created new effectiveness tracking system |
| operations/.docs/skill-metrics-guide.md | Created documentation |

## Success Criteria Met

1. [x] Create operations/skill-metrics.yaml with effectiveness tracking
2. [x] Define metrics: task completion time with/without skills, error rates
3. [x] Create calculation methodology for skill ROI
4. [x] Document how to interpret and act on metrics

## Notes

The system is designed to start collecting data immediately. All metrics are null initially and will be populated as task outcomes are recorded. The weighted scoring system prioritizes success rate (35%) as the most important factor, followed by time efficiency (25%) and trigger accuracy (20%).
