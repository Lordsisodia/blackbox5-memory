notes: |
  Run 57 completed successfully. F-004 (Automated Testing Framework) delivered.

  Key Achievements:
  - Pytest-based test framework operational
  - 21 tests created (9 ConfigManager, 6 sync utilities, 6 integration)
  - Test utilities library with 15+ helper functions
  - Test runner script with multiple options (--unit, --integration, --verbose, --coverage)
  - Comprehensive testing documentation (620 lines)
  - Executor integration complete

  Total: ~2,100 lines delivered

  Feature Delivery Progress: 5/5 planned features complete (F-001, F-005, F-006, F-007, F-004)
  Feature Velocity: 0.29 features/loop (5 features / 17 loops)

  Side Note:
  - Also moved stale recovery task (TASK-1769952153) to completed
  - F-007 was completed before F-004 (out of order due to queue priority)
