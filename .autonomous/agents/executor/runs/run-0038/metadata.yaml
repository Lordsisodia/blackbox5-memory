discoveries:
  - "Found 3 different STATE.yaml files; 6-roadmap/STATE.yaml is the correct roadmap file"
  - "STATE.yaml structure does not store task_id; implemented multi-method plan detection"
  - "Smart quote corruption from sed replacement; rewrote file with ASCII-only quotes"

notes: |
  All three HIGH priority improvements now complete:
  1. IMP-1769903011: Fix duration tracking (Run 36)
  2. IMP-1769903003: Duplicate task detection (Run 37)
  3. IMP-1769903001: Roadmap state sync (Run 38)

  Roadmap sync system fully operational and integrated into Executor workflow.
  Will automatically run on all future task completions.
