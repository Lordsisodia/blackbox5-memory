notes: |
  Roadmap sync integration gap fixed. Extended roadmap_sync.py from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0
  with improvement backlog sync functionality. Added ~200 lines of new code including
  sync_improvement_backlog() and sync_both_on_task_completion() functions. Updated
  Executor workflow to use new sync command that updates both STATE.yaml and
  improvement-backlog.yaml. Manually fixed IMP-1769903008 stale status.

  Success criteria met:
  - roadmap_sync.py extended to update improvement-backlog.yaml ✅
  - Integration point added to Executor workflow ✅
  - improvement-backlog.yaml auto-updates on task completion ✅
  - Tested with 2+ task completions to verify sync works ✅
  - Manual update of stale improvements (1 LOW priority marked complete) ✅

  System health impact: Roadmap sync gap CLOSED. State drift eliminated.
