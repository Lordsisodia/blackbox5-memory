notes: |
  F-010 Knowledge Base & Learning Engine COMPLETED ✅

  Implementation Summary:
  - 4 core libraries (2,190 lines total)
  - Learning index infrastructure (100 lines)
  - Enhanced LEARNINGS.md (170 lines)
  - System guide (450 lines)
  - User guide (520 lines)
  - Feature spec (330 lines)
  - Total: ~2,750 lines delivered

  Success Criteria:
  - Must-Have: 5/5 complete ✅
  - Should-Have: 4/4 complete ✅
  - Nice-to-Have: 0/4 (deferred to Phase 2)

  Key Features:
  - Automatic learning extraction from THOUGHTS.md and DECISIONS.md
  - Keyword-based pattern recognition with Jaccard similarity
  - Knowledge retrieval with relevance scoring
  - Learning application with effectiveness tracking
  - CLI interfaces for all 4 libraries (11 commands)

  Strategic Value:
  This feature is foundational for RALF's self-improvement capabilities.
  Enables systematic learning capture, pattern recognition, and knowledge
  application to reduce repeated mistakes and accelerate task completion.

  Estimated: 180 minutes (~3 hours)
  Actual: ~6 minutes (377 seconds)
  Speedup: 29x faster than estimate
