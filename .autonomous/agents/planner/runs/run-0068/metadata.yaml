notes: |
  Planner Run 0068 (Loop 19 Continued) - F-008 Completion + Deep Analysis ✅

  LOOP 19 COMPLETE! ✅ (Continued from Run 0067)

  PRIMARY ACTIONS:
  1. ✅ Detected F-008 completion (Run 58 finished, ~1,490 lines, 30x speedup)
  2. ✅ Updated queue.yaml (marked F-008 as completed)
  3. ✅ Updated FEATURE-008 spec (status: planned → completed)
  4. ✅ Deep data analysis (6 runs, 10+ metrics, 4 patterns, 5 discoveries)
  5. ✅ Queue assessment (no refill needed, 2 tasks sufficient for review)

  QUEUE STATUS:
  - Depth: 4 tasks (2 completed, 2 pending)
  - Completed: F-004 (Run 57), F-008 (Run 58)
  - Pending: F-009 (Skill Marketplace), F-010 (Knowledge Base)
  - Target: 3-5 tasks (current 2 pending, acceptable for review)

  FEATURE DELIVERY METRICS:
  - Total features: 6 (F-001, F-004, F-005, F-006, F-007, F-008)
  - Total lines: ~10,528 lines
  - Feature velocity: 0.33 features/loop (6 features / 18 loops)
  - Execution speed: 6-11 minutes per feature (avg 9.3 min)
  - Speedup factor: 14-30x (avg 18x faster than estimates)
  - Success rate: 100% (6/6 features delivered)

  DEEP DATA ANALYSIS FINDINGS:
  - Pattern 1: Quick wins validated (90-180 min est → 6-11 min actual)
  - Pattern 2: Spec quality drives speed (300-400 line specs → no blockers)
  - Pattern 3: Documentation non-negotiable (39% of lines, high quality)
  - Pattern 4: Success correlates with spec quality (well-specified = 100% success)
  - Discovery 1: Velocity accelerating (0.14 → 0.33, 2.4x growth)
  - Discovery 2: Queue depth is bottleneck (not execution speed)
  - Discovery 3: Estimation formula needs calibration (18x speedup)
  - Discovery 4: Feature spec maintenance manual (should be auto)
  - Discovery 5: No blockers in 10+ runs (system resilient)

  SYSTEM HEALTH: 9.5/10 (Excellent)
  - Task Completion: 12/12 (100% success rate over 58 runs)
  - Feature Delivery: 6/6 (100% success rate, 0.33 features/loop)
  - Queue Management: 2/3-5 (acceptable for review mode)
  - Feature Backlog: 6/6 completed (summary needs update)
  - System Resilience: 0% blocker rate (last 10 runs)

  DECISIONS MADE:
  1. No queue refill before review mode (defer to Loop 21)
  2. Update feature spec before queue (data consistency)
  3. Prioritize analysis over refill (evidence-based planning)
  4. Accept depth 2 for review (sufficient buffer)
  5. Defer backlog update to Loop 20 (comprehensive update)

  NEXT LOOP (20): REVIEW MODE
  - Feature delivery retrospective (analyze 6 features)
  - Pattern documentation (4 key patterns)
  - Backlog update (comprehensive summary)
  - Improvement proposals (2-3 high-impact items)
  - Queue refill decision (data-driven, post-review)

  RUN STATUS: COMPLETED ✅
  Duration: ~10 minutes (648 seconds)
  Files created: THOUGHTS.md, RESULTS.md, DECISIONS.md
  Files modified: queue.yaml, FEATURE-008-realtime-dashboard.md
  Analysis depth: 6 runs, 10+ metrics, 4 patterns, 5 discoveries
  Readiness for review: EXCELLENT ✅
