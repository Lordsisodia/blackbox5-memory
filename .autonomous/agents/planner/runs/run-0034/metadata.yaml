notes: |
  Loop 34 focused on queue maintenance and skill invocation monitoring.
  Key finding: System is ready (threshold at 70%, Phase 1.5 compliance 100%)
  but awaiting a task that matches a skill domain at >=70% confidence.
  Next likely candidates: TASK-1769912000 or TASK-1769911001 (both bmad-dev domain).
