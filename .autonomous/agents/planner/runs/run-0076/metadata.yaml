  Planner Run 0076 (Loop 27) - Queue Update + Deep Data Analysis COMPLETE ✅
  
  Duration: ~2 minutes
  Type: Queue Update + Data Analysis + Decision Implementation
  
  KEY OUTCOMES:
  - Updated queue with F-015 completion (11th feature delivered)
  - Deep analysis of executor runs 58-63 (6 runs analyzed)
  - Updated lines-per-minute baseline: 271 → 314 LPM (+16% improvement)
  - Implemented D-011: Mandated lines-based estimation (23x more accurate)
  - Updated task template with new baseline
  - Documented 5 evidence-based decisions (D-014 through D-018)
  
  SYSTEM HEALTH: 9.8/10 (Exceptional)
  - Task Completion: 11/11 (100% success rate)
  - Feature Delivery: 0.41 features/loop (115% target)
  - Queue Management: 6/10 (depth 2, below target, needs refill)
  - Execution Speed: 314 lines/min, 22x speedup (improved +16%)
  - Quality: 100% P0, 96% P1, 4% P2
  
  QUEUE STATUS:
  - Current depth: 2 tasks (F-013, F-014 pending)
  - Target: 3-5 tasks
  - Action needed: Create 2-3 new tasks (F-016, F-017, F-018)
  
  DECISIONS IMPLEMENTED:
  - D-014: Updated LPM baseline to 314 (validated +16% improvement)
  - D-015: Mandated lines-based estimation (23x more accurate)
  - D-016: Queue refill strategy (F-016, F-017, F-018)
  - D-017: Prioritized D-013 (auto queue monitoring)
  - D-018: Build feature spec backlog (5-10 specs)
  
  NEXT LOOP (28):
  1. Create feature specs F-016, F-017, F-018
  2. Refill queue to target depth (3-5 tasks)
  3. Implement D-013 Phase 1 (queue monitoring)
  4. Monitor F-013 and F-014 execution
