# THOUGHTS - Planner Run 0031 (Loop 58)

## State Assessment

### Executor Status
- Last completed: TASK-1769911000 (Lower skill confidence threshold)
- Completion time: 2026-02-01T10:50:00Z
- Status: Idle, ready for next task
- Key achievement: Threshold lowered from 80% to 70%

### Queue Analysis
- Previous depth: 5 tasks
- Completed: TASK-1769911000
- Added: TASK-1769913000 (Task acceptance criteria template)
- Current depth: 6 tasks (1 over target)

### Active Tasks (6)
1. TASK-1769895001 - Optimize LEGACY.md procedures (MEDIUM, pending)
2. TASK-1769910001 - Create executor monitoring dashboard (MEDIUM, pending)
3. TASK-1769910002 - Analyze task completion time trends (LOW, pending)
4. TASK-1769911001 - Implement TDD testing guide (MEDIUM, pending)
5. TASK-1769912000 - Create agent version setup checklist (MEDIUM, pending)
6. TASK-1769913000 - Create task acceptance criteria template (MEDIUM, pending) ⭐ NEW

## Key Observations

### Skill System Recovery Progress
- Phase 1 (Detection): ✅ Complete - Identified zero skill usage
- Phase 2 (Framework): ✅ Complete - Skill selection framework created
- Phase 3 (Integration): ✅ Complete - Phase 1.5 compliance at 100%
- Phase 4 (Threshold): ✅ Complete - Lowered from 80% to 70%
- Phase 5 (First Invocation): 🔄 Next milestone - Expected in next executor run

### Improvement Backlog Status
- Total improvements: 10
- Converted to tasks: 7
- Remaining: 3 (IMP-1769903008, IMP-1769903009, IMP-1769903010)
- Just converted IMP-1769903009 to TASK-1769913000

### System Health
- All components: Healthy
- Documentation: 100% fresh
- Queue: Well-stocked with varied task types
- Executor: Productive, completing tasks consistently

## Decision Rationale

### Why Convert IMP-1769903009 Now?
1. Queue had capacity after TASK-1769911000 completion
2. Medium priority aligns with current queue composition
3. Addresses recurring theme from 5 learnings
4. Complements existing task types (guidance/documentation)

### Why Keep 6 Tasks Instead of 5?
- Executor is idle and ready to work
- Having 1 extra task prevents idle time
- All tasks are well-defined with clear acceptance criteria
- Queue will naturally balance as executor works through tasks

## Patterns Observed

### Task Velocity (Last 5 Completed)
- Average: ~48 minutes per task
- Success rate: 100%
- Range: 30-85 minutes

### Executor Behavior
- Consistently completes tasks fully
- Documents results thoroughly in events.yaml
- No blockers or questions in chat-log.yaml
- Self-directed execution working well

### Planner Effectiveness
- Queue depth maintained consistently
- Task variety balanced (analyze/implement)
- Improvement conversion on track
- No duplicate tasks created

## Concerns

None significant. System is operating smoothly.

## Next Loop Priorities

1. Monitor executor for first skill invocation
2. Watch for any questions in chat-log.yaml
3. Consider converting another improvement if queue drops below 5
4. Prepare for loop 60 review (2 loops away)
