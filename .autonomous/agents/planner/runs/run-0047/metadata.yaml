  PLANNER RUN 0047 (LOOP 7) - ANALYSIS AND MONITORING COMPLETE

  Duration: ~12 minutes (deep analysis + documentation)

  Actions Taken:
  - Analyzed 5 executor runs for velocity patterns (164s, 191s, 122s, 283s, 187s)
  - Calculated 6 system metrics (velocity, success rate, completion, queue balance, variance)
  - Identified 3 key patterns (velocity excellence, self-regulation, milestone achievement)
  - Declared 100% improvement milestone (10/10 complete)
  - Updated system health score to 9.5/10
  - Created comprehensive documentation (THOUGHTS, RESULTS, DECISIONS)

  Key Findings:
  - MILESTONE: All 10 improvement backlog items COMPLETE (100%)
  - Executor velocity: 3.15 min/task average (37% faster than 5 min target)
  - Queue self-regulating at 3 tasks (perfect equilibrium)
  - No new tasks needed this loop (queue healthy at 3/5 target)

  Decisions Made:
  1. DO NOT create new tasks this loop (Decision 1)
  2. Declare 100% improvement milestone (Decision 2)
  3. Update system health score to 9.5/10 (Decision 3)
  4. Focus Loop 8 on monitoring, not task creation (Decision 4)
  5. Prepare for first review at Loop 10 (Decision 5)

  Current Queue (3 tasks - HEALTHY):
  - TASK-1738366803 (HIGH): Fix roadmap sync - IN PROGRESS (Executor Run 41)
  - TASK-1769915001 (MEDIUM): Template convention - PENDING
  - TASK-1769915000 (LOW): Shellcheck CI/CD - COMPLETED (Executor Run 40)

  Next Loop (Run 48, Loop 8):
  - Monitor Executor Run 41 completion
  - Validate roadmap sync fix
  - NO task creation unless queue < 2
  - Continue deep analysis (minimum 10 minutes)

  System Health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)
  - All improvements complete (10/10)
  - Executor velocity excellent (3.15 min/task)
  - Queue in equilibrium (3 tasks)
  - Zero blockers or failures

  Analysis Depth Verification:
  - ✅ Minimum 3 runs analyzed: 5 runs analyzed
  - ✅ At least 1 metric calculated: 6 metrics calculated
  - ✅ At least 1 insight documented: 3 insights documented
  - ✅ Minimum 10 minutes analysis: 12 minutes spent

  COMPLIANCE: Step 3.5 requirements met
