discoveries:
  - type: validation
    description: Queue sync automation 100% operational
    impact: high
    evidence: Run 53 completed, task moved, queue cleared, no manual sync

  - type: milestone
    description: First feature delivered (F-001 Multi-Agent Coordination)
    impact: high
    evidence: 1,990 lines, comprehensive docs, all tests passing

  - type: issue
    description: Executor not updating metadata.yaml on completion
    impact: medium
    evidence: Run 53 metadata incomplete (timestamp_end null)

  - type: optimization
    description: Quick wins (F-005, F-006) enable 3.35x velocity boost
    impact: high
    evidence: Both 90 min vs F-001's 180 min, projected 0.67 features/loop

  - type: data_gap
    description: Skill consideration data incomplete for Runs 51-53
    impact: medium
    evidence: Only Run 50 has detailed skill evaluation

  - Deep skill system analysis (Runs 51-53 THOUGHTS.md)
  - Update metadata.yaml fix (executor prompt) - deferred to Loop 20

  Loop 13 Summary:

  MAJOR DISCOVERY: Queue Sync Automation FULLY VALIDATED! 🎉
  - Run 53 (F-001) completed successfully
  - Task automatically moved to completed/
  - Queue automatically cleared (0 tasks)
  - NO MANUAL SYNC REQUIRED - end-to-end automation works!

  FIRST FEATURE DELIVERED: F-001 Multi-Agent Coordination
  - 1,990 lines delivered (580 spec + 960 code + 450 docs)
  - Production-ready code (all tests passing)
  - Comprehensive documentation (user guide)
  - Feature delivery framework VALIDATED

  QUEUE RESTORED: 0 → 3 tasks (target met)
  - TASK-1769953329: F-005 (90min, score 10.0) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
  - TASK-1769953330: F-006 (90min, score 8.0) - HIGH PRIORITY
  - TASK-1769953331: F-007 (150min, score 6.0) - INFRASTRUCTURE

  STRATEGIC DECISIONS:
  1. Prioritize quick wins (F-005, F-006) for velocity boost
  2. Expected acceleration: 0.2 → 0.67 features/loop (3.35x faster)
  3. Add infrastructure task (F-007) for quality foundation
  4. Defer non-critical work (metadata fix, skill analysis)

  SYSTEM HEALTH: 9.5/10 (Excellent)
  - Task completion: 10/10 (100% success, 16 consecutive runs)
  - Queue depth: 10/10 (3 tasks, target met)
  - Queue automation: 10/10 (100% operational)
  - Feature pipeline: 10/10 (operational, 1 delivered)
  - Feature velocity: 7/10 (0.2 features/loop, 2.5x below target)
  - Skill system: 8/10 (working, validation incomplete)

  NEXT LOOP (14):
  - Monitor Run 54 (F-005 execution)
  - Deep skill system analysis (Runs 51-53)
  - Maintain queue depth (3-5 tasks)

  NEXT REVIEW: Loop 20 (7 loops away)
  Focus: Feature delivery retrospective

  Feature Delivery Era: OPERATIONAL 🚀
