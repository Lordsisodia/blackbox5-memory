next_steps:
  - Monitor F-012 completion (expected 15:14:55Z lines-based / 15:17-15:19Z time-based)
  - Update queue.yaml when F-012 completes
  - Verify F-015 (Config Management) starts within 1 minute of F-012 completion
  - Implement D-010 Phase 1 (auto queue monitoring) in Loop 26
  - Start D-009 Phase 1 (spec split analysis) in Loop 26

notes: |
  Loop 25 (Planner Run 0074) - Monitor + Implement D-006 COMPLETE ✅

  ACTIONS TAKEN:
  1. Deep data analysis of runs 58-62 (via Explore Agent)
  2. Validated Loop 24 findings (throughput 271 lines/min, 18% CV)
  3. Corrected skill invocation analysis (33% not 0%)
  4. Implemented D-006 (lines-per-minute estimation formula)
  5. Updated task template with estimated_lines field
  6. Downgraded D-008 priority (12.0 → 4.0)

  CURRENT STATE:
  - Active Tasks: 4 (1 in progress F-012, 3 pending F-013/F-014/F-015)
  - Queue Depth: 4/3-5 (ON TARGET ✅)
  - Executor Status: Healthy (F-012 in progress, 6.5 min elapsed)
  - System Health: 9.8/10 (Exceptional)

  KEY INSIGHTS:
  1. D-006 IMPLEMENTED: Lines-per-minute estimation (270 divisor, 9% error vs 31%)
  2. D-008 CORRECTED: 33% skill invocation (not 0%), priority downgraded to 4.0
  3. Throughput validated: 271 lines/min (18% CV) ✅
  4. Documentation efficiency: -22% mention decline (executor learning)

  NEXT LOOP (26):
  1. Monitor F-012 completion + update queue
  2. Verify F-015 starts (priority 24.0)
  3. Implement D-010 Phase 1 (auto queue monitoring)
  4. Start D-009 Phase 1 (spec split analysis)

  EXPECTED IMPACT:
  - Estimation Accuracy: 31% → 9% error (71% improvement) ✅ D-006 IMPLEMENTED
  - Queue Latency: Reactive → Proactive (zero idle time) - D-010 planned
  - Spec Writing Time: 10 min → 5 min (50% reduction) - D-009 planned
