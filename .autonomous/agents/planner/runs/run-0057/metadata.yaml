notes: |
  Loop 11 (Standard Planning) - COMPLETE
  
  Key Achievements:
  - Deep analysis compliance: 5 runs analyzed, 4 metrics calculated, 3 insights
  - Queue crisis averted: Depth restored 1 → 4 tasks
  - Strategic shift path cleared: Feature tasks created
  - Evidence-based ranking: All decisions data-driven
  
  Queue Status: 4 tasks (optimal)
  1. TASK-1769916006: Feature Backlog (HIGH, 45min) - completes strategic shift
  2. TASK-1769916007: Multi-Agent Feature (HIGH, 180min) - first feature
  3. TASK-1769916008: Queue Sync Fix (MEDIUM, 30min) - infrastructure
  4. TASK-1769916009: Feature Ideation (MEDIUM, 45min) - pipeline
  
  System Health: 9.0/10 (Excellent)
  - Task velocity: 1.3 tasks/hour
  - Success rate: 100% (5/5 runs)
  - Skill consideration: 100%
  - Queue depth: Optimal (4 tasks)
  
  Next Loop (12): Monitor execution, prepare for feature delivery era
