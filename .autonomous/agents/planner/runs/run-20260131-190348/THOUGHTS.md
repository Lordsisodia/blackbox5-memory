## Thought Process

### Initial Analysis
RALF started execution on branch `legacy/autonomous-improvement` (not main/master, safe to proceed).

Active task: `continuous-improvement.md` - A perpetual task for analyzing and improving Blackbox5 codebase quality.

### First Principles Breakdown

**Objective:** Make at least one concrete improvement to the codebase this run.

**Success Criteria:**
1. Find a code quality issue
2. Fix it with a proper commit
3. Document the change

**Approach:**
1. Scan codebase for common issues (bare except clauses, unused imports, etc.)
2. Select one issue to fix
3. Create fix with proper testing
4. Commit with descriptive message
5. Update documentation

### Execution

Started scanning the 2-engine/ directory for potential improvements...

Found recent commit history shows multiple fixes for bare except clauses (6cbab9b, 2b43ea1, d04752f, b4e31f2, 2ec9dfb). This suggests the pattern is known but may be more instances.

**Found 2 files with bare except clauses:**

1. **AgentOutputBus.py:390** - In `get_recent_deliverables()` method, when parsing JSON from database
   - Current: `except: continue`
   - Issue: Silently ignores JSON parsing errors
   - Fix: `except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError, KeyError): continue`

2. **vector_store.py:62** - In `_setup_chromadb()` method, when getting ChromaDB collection
   - Current: `except:` (assumes collection doesn't exist)
   - Issue: Catches all exceptions including chromadb errors
   - Fix: `except chromadb.errors.InvalidCollectionException:` (only catch collection-not-found)

**Decision:** Fix both issues in a single commit since they're related (same code quality pattern - bare except clauses).

### Fixes Applied

**1. AgentOutputBus.py:390**
- Changed: `except:` → `except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError, KeyError):`
- Rationale: Only catch JSON parsing errors, not all exceptions

**2. vector_store.py:62**
- Changed: `except:` → `except ValueError:`
- Rationale: ChromaDB raises ValueError when collection not found
- Added comment explaining the exception case
