notes: |
  Skill system recovery is progressing well. Phase 1.5 fix is working (100% consideration
  rate), but confidence threshold may need adjustment. Run-0022 had valid skill match
  at 70% confidence, which was below the 80% threshold. Monitoring next 3 runs before
  making threshold adjustment decision.
