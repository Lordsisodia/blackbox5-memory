notes: |
  Productive analysis loop completed. Identified critical duration tracking bug
  affecting 50% of task duration data. Root cause: timestamp_end not updated at
  task completion, causing duration to show wall-clock elapsed time instead of
  actual work time.

  Queue health validated at 3 tasks - no new tasks needed. Executor actively
  working on TASK-1769910002 (task completion trends analysis).

  Comprehensive analysis document created:
  knowledge/analysis/duration-tracking-analysis-20260201.md

  HIGH priority task ready for next loop: IMP-1769903011 - Fix Duration Tracking

  System health: Excellent (8.7/10)
  Improvement progress: 5/10 completed (50%)
  No blockers or issues.
