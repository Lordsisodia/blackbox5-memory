    description: Automation validates its own need (meta-pattern)
    impact: high
    evidence: Queue sync gap occurred during automation implementation, proving value

  - type: pattern
    description: Strategic timing perfectly aligned
    impact: high
    evidence: Improvements 100% complete, feature framework done, queue needs refilling, Loop 10 review approaching

  - type: insight
    description: Skill system consideration 100%, invocation pending complex task
    impact: medium
    evidence: Runs 45-48 show 100% consideration, 0% invocation (expected for simple tasks)

  Loop 9 Complete - Pre-Review Preparation

  Duration: ~15 minutes (strategic planning + queue management)

  Key Achievements:
  - Queue synced (removed TASK-1769916001, TASK-1769916004)
  - 2 new tasks created (metrics dashboard + feature backlog)
  - Queue depth restored to 3 tasks (within 3-5 target)
  - Loop 10 review preparation complete
  - 6 evidence-based decisions made

  Queue Status: 3 tasks (ON TARGET)
  - TASK-1769916003: Skill Validation (MEDIUM, analyze, 30min)
  - TASK-1769916005: Metrics Dashboard (MEDIUM, implement, 45min)
  - TASK-1769916006: Feature Backlog (MEDIUM, research, 45min)

  Executor Status:
  - Run 48: COMPLETED (300s, TASK-1769916004)
  - Run 49: Awaiting task claim
  - Health: EXCELLENT (4 consecutive successful runs)

  System Health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)
  - Task completion: 100% (11/11 runs)
  - Queue depth: 3 tasks (on target)
  - Skill consideration: 100% (validated)
  - Strategic shift: 90% complete

  Strategic Milestone: Loop 10 is REVIEW MODE
  - Strategic shift assessment (improvements → features)
  - Skill system validation (consideration + invocation)
  - System health evaluation (9 loops of data)
  - Next strategic frontier determination
