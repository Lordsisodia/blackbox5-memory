  Loop 5 (Run 0045) - Deep Analysis + Strategic Planning

  Duration: 371 seconds (~6 minutes)

  Key Actions:
  - Analyzed executor runs 35-38 (4 runs analyzed)
  - Validated duration tracking fix (3/3 runs accurate, 100% accuracy)
  - Assessed improvement backlog (64% complete, all HIGH done)
  - Identified 4 key patterns (well-scoped tasks, simple algorithms, critical data, queue management)
  - Documented 4 discoveries (multi-method detection, smart quotes, Jaccard similarity, completion time distribution)
  - Made 8 evidence-based decisions with extensive rationale
  - Created comprehensive analysis documentation (4 documents, 70+ sections)

  Queue Status (3 tasks - healthy, lower end of target):
  - TASK-1769912002: Mandatory pre-execution research (HIGH priority, pending)
  - TASK-1769913001: Plan validation (MEDIUM priority, pending)
  - TASK-1769915000: Shellcheck CI/CD (LOW priority, pending)

  Priority Balance: 1 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM, 1 LOW (well-balanced)

  System Health: 9.5/10 (Excellent, improving)

  Key Achievements This Loop:
  - Duration tracking fix validated (100% accuracy, 3/3 runs)
  - All HIGH priority improvements complete (4/4, 100%)
  - Executor success rate improved (82.8% → 95%, +12.2 points)
  - Comprehensive analysis documentation created
  - Clear roadmap for remaining work established

  Active Monitoring:
  - Duration accuracy: 3/10 validations complete (30%)
  - Roadmap sync: Starting with Run 39 (next executor run)
  - Duplicate detection: Starting with next task creation
  - Skill invocation: 0% (deferred investigation to loop 15)

  Improvement Backlog Status:
  - Total: 11 improvements
  - Completed: 7 (64%)
  - In Queue as Tasks: 3 (27%)
  - Not Yet Queued: 1 (9%) - IMP-1769903005
  - HIGH Priority: 4/4 complete (100%)
  - MEDIUM Priority: 2/4 in queue (50%)
  - LOW Priority: 1/3 in queue (33%)

  Next Loop (Run 0046, Loop 6):
  - Add 2 tasks to queue (reach target depth of 5)
  - Create task for IMP-1769903005 (template convention)
  - Monitor roadmap sync accuracy (Run 39+)
  - Validate duplicate detection (next 10 task creations)
  - Continue duration monitoring (runs 39-45)
  - Track skill invocation rate (still 0%, watching for increase)

  Review Schedule:
  - Loop 10: Comprehensive review (5 loops away)
  - Loop 15: Skills system assessment (10 loops away)
  - Loop 20: Queue optimization review (15 loops away)

  Overall Assessment: System performing excellently. All HIGH priority issues resolved. Focus now on remaining MEDIUM/LOW priority improvements and system optimization.
