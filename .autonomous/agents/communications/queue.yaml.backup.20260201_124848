    title: Enforce Template File Naming Convention
    priority: medium
    estimated_minutes: 35
    context_level: 2
    improvement: IMP-1769903005
    approach: |
      Implement and enforce template file naming convention to prevent confusion
      and reduce false bug reports. Document convention, update agent instructions,
      validate existing templates follow convention.
    files_to_modify:
      - .docs/template-system-guide.md
      - STATE.yaml
      - ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
      - All .template files (audit and ensure compliance)
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Template file naming convention documented
      - Convention added to .docs/ system for visibility
      - Templates renamed to follow convention (if needed)
      - Template system guide created or updated
      - CLAUDE.md updated with template handling rules

    title: Monitor Skill System Validation
    priority: medium
    estimated_minutes: 30
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Validate that Step 2.5 (Skill Checking) integration from TASK-1769916002 is
      working effectively. Monitor the next 3 executor runs to ensure 100% skill
      consideration rate and track invocation patterns.
    files_to_modify:
      - knowledge/analysis/skill-validation-analysis-20260201.md (create)
      - operations/skill-selection.yaml (possibly, for threshold tuning)
    acceptance_criteria:
      - 3 executor runs analyzed (Runs 46-48)
      - Skill consideration rate calculated (target: 100%)
      - Skill invocation rate calculated (target: 10-30%)
      - Analysis document created with data tables
      - Effectiveness documented with recommendations
      - Follow-up task created if rates below target
    dependencies:
      - TASK-1769916002 (must complete first)

    title: Automate Queue Management
    priority: low
    estimated_minutes: 40
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Implement automatic synchronization between active/ directory and queue.yaml
      to prevent sync issues. Create queue_sync.py library, integrate into task
      completion workflow, test with 2+ completions.
    files_to_modify:

      - .autonomous/communications/queue.yaml (test)
      - operations/.docs/queue-management-guide.md (create)
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Queue sync library created
      - Integration point added to workflow
      - Completed tasks auto-removed from queue
      - Test with 2+ task completions
      - No manual queue management needed

    title: Create Feature Delivery Framework
    priority: medium
    estimated_minutes: 45
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Establish a framework for delivering user-facing features, enabling the
      strategic shift from improvement-based tasks (now exhausted) to value-
      creating feature delivery. Define feature vs improvement criteria, create
      feature task template, document feature delivery process.

      - operations/.docs/feature-delivery-guide.md (create)
      - plans/features/BACKLOG.md (create or update)
      - plans/features/EXAMPLE-feature-skill-dashboard.md (create)
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Feature vs improvement criteria clearly defined
      - Feature task template created and usable
      - Feature delivery guide documents complete process
      - Feature backlog organized with existing features
      - Example feature validates framework
      - Framework documented in operations/.docs/

    Planner Run 0051 Queue Update:
    - Synchronized queue (removed TASK-1769916000 completed)
    - Added 2 strategic tasks (reached depth 4)
    - TASK-1769916003: Monitor Skill System Validation (analyze, MEDIUM)
    - TASK-1769916004: Create Feature Delivery Framework (implement, MEDIUM)
    - Queue now at optimal depth with diverse task types

    Current Queue (4 tasks - OPTIMAL):
    1. TASK-1769915001: Template Convention (MEDIUM, implement, 35min)
       - Last improvement task, completes 100% milestone
    2. TASK-1769916003: Skill Validation (MEDIUM, analyze, 30min)
       - Validates Step 2.5 integration, monitors next 3 runs
    3. TASK-1769916001: Queue Automation (LOW, implement, 40min)
       - Prevents sync issues, proved valuable this run
    4. TASK-1769916004: Feature Framework (MEDIUM, implement, 45min)
       - Enables strategic shift, establishes new task source

    Recent Completions (Last 3 Runs):
    - Run 43: Roadmap sync regex fix (157s, TASK-1738366803)
    - Run 44: Skill usage gap investigation (368s, TASK-1769916000)
    - Run 45: Add Phase 1.5 to executor prompt (80s, TASK-1769916002)

    Executor Status:
    - Run 45: COMPLETED (12:34:25Z, 80 seconds)
    - Skill system: FIXED (Step 2.5 integrated)
    - Health: EXCELLENT (3 consecutive successful runs)

    System Health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)
    - Executor velocity: ~3.4 min/task (stable)
    - Success rate: 100% (3/3 runs completed)
    - Skill system: FIXED (validation in progress)
    - Queue depth: 4 tasks (optimal)
    - Strategic shift: In progress (improvements → features)

    Next Actions:
    1. Monitor skill validation (TASK-1769916003, next 3 runs)
    2. Complete last improvement (TASK-1769915001)
    3. Implement queue automation (TASK-1769916001)
    4. Establish feature framework (TASK-1769916004)
