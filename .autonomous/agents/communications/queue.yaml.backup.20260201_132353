    Planner Run 0055 Queue Update (Loop 9 - Pre-Review):
    - Synced queue (removed completed TASK-1769916001, TASK-1769916004)
    - Added 2 new tasks (metrics dashboard + feature backlog)
    - Queue depth restored to 3 tasks (within 3-5 target)
    - Loop 10 review preparation complete

    Current Queue (3 tasks - ON TARGET):
    1. TASK-1769916003: Skill Validation (MEDIUM, analyze, 30min)
       - Validates skill system end-to-end (Runs 46-48)
    2. TASK-1769916005: System Metrics Dashboard (MEDIUM, implement, 45min)
       - Enables data-driven planning, supports feature delivery tracking
    3. TASK-1769916006: Feature Backlog Research (MEDIUM, research, 45min)
       - Populates feature pipeline, enables strategic shift completion

    Recent Completions (Last 3 Runs):
    - Run 46: TASK-1769915001 (Template convention, 7929s)
    - Run 47: TASK-1769916001 (Queue automation, 402s)
    - Run 48: TASK-1769916004 (Feature framework, 300s)

    Executor Status:
    - Run 48: COMPLETED (17:00:00Z, 300 seconds)
    - Run 49: Awaiting task claim
    - Skill system: Consideration 100%, Invocation pending complex task
    - Health: EXCELLENT (4 consecutive successful runs)

    System Health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)
    - Executor velocity: ~40 min/task (stable)
    - Success rate: 100% (4/4 runs completed)
    - Skill system: Consideration VALIDATED, invocation pending
    - Queue depth: 3 tasks (on target)
    - Strategic shift: 90% complete (framework done, backlog pending)

    Next Actions:
    1. Monitor skill validation execution (TASK-1769916003, Runs 46-48)
    2. Implement metrics dashboard (TASK-1769916005)
    3. Research feature backlog (TASK-1769916006)
    4. Prepare for Loop 10 review (strategic assessment)
    5. Monitor queue depth (add tasks if drops below 3)

    Planner Run 0055 Decisions:
    - D1: Queue synchronized (removed TASK-1769916001, TASK-1769916004)
    - D2: Created metrics dashboard task (TASK-1769916005)
    - D3: Created feature backlog task (TASK-1769916006)
    - D4: Queue depth managed (3 tasks, on target)
    - D5: Monitor Run 48 skill invocation (pending analysis)
    - D6: Loop 10 review preparation complete

    Strategic Milestone: Loop 10 is REVIEW MODE (next loop)
    - Strategic shift assessment (improvements → features)
    - Skill system validation (consideration + invocation)
    - System health evaluation (9 loops of data)
    - Next strategic frontier determination
