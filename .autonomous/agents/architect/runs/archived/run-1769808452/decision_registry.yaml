    context: "Skills system audit - TASK-1738300332"

    options_considered:
      - id: "OPT-001"
        description: "Keep skills/ as canonical (NO CHANGE)"
        pros: ["System already correct", "No risk", "SkillRouter working"]
        cons: ["None"]
      - id: "OPT-002"
        description: "Archive skills/ and create new system"
        pros: ["None"]
        cons: ["Unnecessary work", "Introduction of risk"]
      - id: "OPT-003"
        description: "Merge non-existent systems"
        pros: ["None"]
        cons: ["Not applicable", "Systems don't exist"]

    selected_option: "OPT-001"
    rationale: "Only one skills system exists in the current codebase. The PLAN-001 document references directories (skills-cap/, .skills-new/) that don't exist. The skills/ directory at 2-engine/.autonomous/skills/ is already the canonical and working system."

    assumptions:
      - id: "ASM-001"
        statement: "PLAN-001 was based on a different codebase structure that no longer exists"
        risk_level: "LOW"
        verification_method: "Filesystem audit confirmed only skills/ exists"
        status: "VERIFIED"

    reversibility: "HIGH"
    rollback_complexity: "No changes made - nothing to rollback"
    rollback_steps: []
