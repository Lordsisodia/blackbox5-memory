# LEARNINGS: Loop 40

## What Was Learned

### 1. Roadmap State Can Become Outdated
The STATE.yaml file didn't reflect actual completed work. This caused an attempt to redo completed work.

### 2. Check Completed Tasks First
Before starting any roadmap task, always search for existing completed tasks with similar keywords.

### 3. PLAN-005 Was Actually a Different Issue
The task was named "Initialize Vibe Kanban Database" but the actual issue was port configuration. The solution was port auto-detection, not database initialization.

## Process Improvement

**Pre-Execution Checklist (Updated):**
1. ✅ Check for active tasks
2. ✅ Check recent runs
3. ✅ **NEW: Search for completed tasks with same keywords**
4. ✅ Verify roadmap state against actual completion history

## Next Steps

1. Execute PLAN-003 (Implement Planning Agent) - now unblocked
2. Consider updating roadmap STATE.yaml automatically when tasks complete
