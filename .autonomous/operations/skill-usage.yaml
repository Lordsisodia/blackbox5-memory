# Usage Tracking Instructions
# ===========================
#
# To update after a skill is used:
# 1. Find the skill by name
# 2. Increment usage_count
# 3. Update last_used timestamp (ISO 8601 format)
# 4. Increment success_count or failure_count
# 5. Update avg_execution_time_ms using:
#    new_avg = ((old_avg * (count - 1)) + new_time) / count
# 6. Recalculate effectiveness_score = success_count / usage_count
#
# To add a new skill:
# 1. Copy an existing skill entry as template
# 2. Update all fields appropriately
# 3. Add triggers that should activate this skill
# 4. Update metadata.categories count if new category
#
# To query skill usage:
# - Most used: sort by usage_count descending
# - Most effective: sort by effectiveness_score descending
# - Stale skills: filter by last_used > 30 days ago
# - Underutilized: usage_count < 5 AND age > 30 days
