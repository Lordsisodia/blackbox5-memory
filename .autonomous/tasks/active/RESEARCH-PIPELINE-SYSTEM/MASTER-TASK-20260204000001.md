# MASTER-TASK-20260204000001: Build Multi-Agent Research Pipeline System

**Task ID:** MASTER-TASK-20260204000001
**Type:** epic
**Priority:** critical
**Status:** in_progress
**Created:** 2026-02-04T00:00:01Z
**Estimated Lines:** N/A (system architecture task)

---

## Objective

Build a continuous multi-agent research pipeline system that automatically scans GitHub/YouTube/sources, extracts patterns, ranks by complexity/value, and generates implementation tasks. This replaces manual repo-by-repo analysis with parallel autonomous research.

---

## Context

Current workflow is sequential and inefficient:
- One agent analyzes one repo at a time
- Manual task creation after analysis
- No comparison between sources
- No complexity ranking

Proposed system:
- Agent 1: Continuous research scout
- Agent 2: Integration analyst (complexity/value ranking)
- Agent 3: Task planner (breaks down into subtasks)
- Agent 4: Executor (selective implementation)

BB5 has existing infrastructure:
- Redis-based agent coordination (1ms latency)
- Task registry with dependency tracking
- Orchestrator with wave-based parallelization
- File-based and pub/sub communication protocols
- 22+ BMAD skills available

## Pipeline Architecture

### Agent 1: Research Scout (Continuous)
**Role:** Constantly scan sources, map concepts, identify overlaps
**Inputs:** GitHub repos, YouTube videos, documentation
**Outputs:** Concept map with source attribution
**Storage:** Shared concept database
**Trigger:** Continuous + on-demand

### Agent 2: Integration Analyst (Continuous)
**Role:** Analyze complexity to integrate, complexity to maintain
**Inputs:** Concept map from Agent 1
**Outputs:** Ranked recommendations with trade-off analysis
**Formula:** value / (integration_cost + maintenance_cost)
**Trigger:** When Agent 1 updates concept map

### Agent 3: Task Planner (Triggered)
**Role:** Plan implementation, create subtasks, set up BB5 structure
**Inputs:** Top-ranked recommendations
**Outputs:** Ready-to-execute task packages with folders
**Trigger:** When recommendations pass threshold

### Agent 4: Executor (Selective)
**Role:** Implement tasks one at a time
**Inputs:** Planned task packages
**Outputs:** Completed implementations
**Trigger:** Manual or scheduled (one task at a time)

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Research Scout agent operational and scanning sources
- [ ] Integration Analyst ranking recommendations automatically
- [ ] Task Planner creating proper BB5 task structures
- [ ] Executor implementing tasks selectively
- [ ] Pipeline processes 10+ sources in parallel
- [ ] Tasks auto-generated with complexity/value rankings
- [ ] Human approval gates at appropriate points
- [ ] System uses existing BB5 infrastructure (Redis, queues, skills)

## BB5 Infrastructure to Leverage

### Communication
- **File-based:** queue.yaml, events.yaml, chat-log.yaml, heartbeat.yaml
- **Redis:** Pub/sub channels (1ms latency)
- **Protocol:** Existing YAML-based agent communication

### Storage
- **Task Registry:** core/autonomous/schemas/task.py
- **Redis Store:** Atomic operations, sorted sets
- **JSON/SQLite:** Multi-tier storage
- **Knowledge Graph:** Neo4j for concept relationships

### Coordination
- **Orchestrator:** Wave-based parallelization
- **Redis Coordinator:** Agent status tracking
- **EventBus:** Event-driven coordination

### Skills
- **bmad-analyst:** Research and analysis
- **bmad-architect:** System design
- **bmad-dev:** Implementation
- **bmad-tea:** Task execution

## Human Approval Gates

1. **Concept Map Review** - After Agent 1 identifies overlaps
2. **Recommendation Approval** - Before Agent 3 plans tasks
3. **Task Package Review** - Before Agent 4 executes
4. **Implementation Review** - After Agent 4 completes

## Notes

This system will transform BB5 from manual research to autonomous continuous improvement. Agents work in parallel, specialized by role, with clear handoffs and human oversight at key decision points.

The pipeline should be able to:
1. Discover patterns from multiple sources simultaneously
2. Compare and rank implementations objectively
3. Generate properly structured BB5 tasks automatically
4. Execute selectively based on priority and capacity

Compute efficiency: Agents 1-2 run continuously (low cost), Agent 3 runs on trigger (medium), Agent 4 runs selectively (higher cost but controlled).
