# TASK-1769910002: Analyze Task Completion Time Trends

**Type:** analyze
**Priority:** low
**Status:** pending
**Created:** 2026-02-01T09:10:00Z
**Estimated Minutes:** 35
**Context Level:** 2

## Objective
Analyze task completion times across recent runs to identify trends and improve estimation accuracy.

## Context
Task time estimates vary in accuracy. Understanding which task types take longer and common bottlenecks will help improve planning and resource allocation.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 20+ tasks analyzed for completion time
- [ ] Trends identified and documented
- [ ] Estimation accuracy calculated
- [ ] Guidelines for future estimations provided

## Approach
1. Extract completion times from recent run metadata
2. Categorize by task type (implement, analyze, fix, etc.)
3. Compare estimated vs actual times
4. Identify patterns and outliers
5. Create estimation guidelines

## Files to Modify
- knowledge/analysis/task-completion-trends-20260201.md
- operations/estimation-guidelines.yaml

## Dependencies
None

## Notes
Focus on practical recommendations for improving estimation accuracy.
