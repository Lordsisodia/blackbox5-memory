# TASK-1769895001: Optimize LEGACY.md Operational Procedures

**Type:** analyze
**Priority:** medium
**Status:** pending
**Created:** 2026-02-01T08:05:00Z
**Estimated Minutes:** 40
**Context Level:** 3

## Objective
Analyze LEGACY.md for friction points and inefficiencies in operational procedures. Focus on skill discovery, quality gates, and run initialization to create specific recommendations for optimization.

## Context
LEGACY.md contains the operational procedures for the autonomous agent system. Recent analysis has identified potential friction points in:
- Skill discovery process (may be too slow)
- Quality gates (could be more specific)
- Run initialization (setup time could be reduced)

This analysis will inform improvements to the operational efficiency of the system.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Analysis document created at `knowledge/analysis/legacy-md-optimization.md`
- [ ] At least 3 friction points identified
- [ ] Concrete optimization recommendations provided
- [ ] Recommendations prioritize by impact/effort ratio

## Approach
1. Read LEGACY.md thoroughly
2. Identify friction points in each major section
3. Compare with actual execution patterns from recent runs
4. Document findings with specific recommendations
5. Prioritize recommendations

## Files to Analyze
- `~/.blackbox5/5-project-memory/siso-internal/.Autonomous/LEGACY.md`
- Recent executor runs for validation

## Notes
- Focus on measurable improvements
- Consider both human and AI agent experience
- Look for patterns in recent runs that indicate friction
