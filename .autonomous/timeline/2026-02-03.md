### YouTube Extraction Process Improvement
**Time**: 23:15 - 23:50
**Type**: Research & Development

**Summary**:
Analyzed two separate extractions of the same IndyDevDan video and discovered significant coverage gaps (20-30% miss rate). Implemented new 3×3 parallel extraction methodology.

**Key Findings**:
- Single 3-iteration extraction: ~70-75% coverage
- Two extractions of same video: 40-53% unique concepts between them
- Score inconsistency: Same concepts rated 1-17 points differently

**Solution Implemented**:
- New 3×3 process: 3 parallel extractions × 3 iterations each + synthesis
- Expected coverage: 98% (vs 95% single)
- Trade-off: 3× API cost for ~30% more coverage

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `.docs/CLAUDE-EXTRACTION-PROCESS.md` (updated to v2.0)
- `scripts/extract_claude_v2.py` (new 3×3 implementation)
- Task tracking in `tasks/active/YOUTUBE-EXTRACTION-IMPROVEMENT/`

**Next Steps**:
- Full sub-agent spawning implementation
- Test on multiple videos to validate coverage improvement
