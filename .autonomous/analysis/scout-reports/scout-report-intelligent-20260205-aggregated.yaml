      is not being used. All metrics are null, usage is zero, and tasks are completing
      without skill invocation.

    description: 'Multiple metric files have empty usage_log or tracking arrays despite
      system activity: validation-checklist.yaml, skill-usage.yaml, LEARNINGS.md.

  - name: Template System Creates Files But Content Never Filled
    description: A recurring pattern where template files (THOUGHTS.md, LEARNINGS.md,
      RESULTS.md) are auto-created with 'UNFILLED' markers but agents never populate
      them with actual content.
