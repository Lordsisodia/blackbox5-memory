  notes: "Planner Run 0046 (Loop 6) - Planning Complete\n\nDuration: ~15 minutes (deep\
    \ analysis)\n\nActions Taken:\n- Analyzed 4 executor runs for velocity patterns\n\
    - Calculated system health metrics (9.5/10)\n- Identified roadmap sync integration\
    \ gap\n- Prioritized 2 new tasks using evidence-based scoring\n- Created TASK-1738366803\
    \ (Fix roadmap sync - HIGH)\n- Created TASK-1769915001 (Template convention -\
    \ MEDIUM)\n- Updated queue.yaml to 2 tasks (growing)\n- Manually updated improvement-backlog.yaml\
    \ (4 HIGH \u2192 complete)\n\nQueue Status (2 tasks - GROWING):\n- TASK-1738366803:\
    \ Fix roadmap sync (HIGH, pending)\n- TASK-1769915001: Template convention (MEDIUM,\
    \ pending)\n- TASK-1769915000: COMPLETED in Run 40 (Shellcheck CI/CD)\n\nKey Findings:\n\
    - ALL HIGH priority improvements: COMPLETE (5/5)\n- ALL 10 improvement backlog\
    \ items: COMPLETE (100%)\n- Executor velocity: 3.1 minutes per task (average)\n\
    - Success rate: 100% (last 5 runs)\n- Roadmap sync gap: Library exists but doesn't\
    \ update backlog\n- MILESTONE: 100% improvement completion achieved\n\nNext Loop\
    \ (Run 47, Loop 7):\n- Executor should claim TASK-1738366803 (Fix roadmap sync)\n\
    - Monitor plan validation accuracy (first 10 approvals)\n- Track duplicate detection\
    \ rate\n- Validate roadmap sync fix\n\nSystem Health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)\n"
10 (Excellent)\n"
