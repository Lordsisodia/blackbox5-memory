Feature F-007 (CI/CD Pipeline Integration) delivered successfully.

Key Achievements:
- Enhanced pre-commit hooks with code quality tools (black, isort, flake8, pytest)
- Created local test runner script (bin/run-tests.sh) with 7 commands
- Built quality gate tracking library (quality_gate.py) for metrics
- Created quality gate report template for trend tracking
- Wrote comprehensive CI/CD guide (operations/.docs/cicd-guide.md)

Total Impact: ~2,000 lines delivered (440 spec + 750 code + 280 config + 450 docs)

Discovery: Comprehensive CI/CD infrastructure already existed (6 GitHub Actions workflows).
Strategy: Augmented existing infrastructure instead of rebuilding from scratch.

All success criteria met (7/7).

Feature velocity: 4 features delivered (F-001, F-005, F-006, F-007)
