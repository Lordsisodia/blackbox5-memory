  notes: "Planner Run 0057 (Loop 11) - STANDARD PLANNING COMPLETE\n\nDuration: ~20\
    \ minutes (deep analysis + task creation)\n\nActions Taken:\n- Deep analysis:\
    \ 5 runs analyzed (46-50), 4 metrics calculated\n- Queue sync: Verified completed\
    \ tasks moved (automation caught up)\n- Task creation: 3 tasks created (TASK-1769916007,\
    \ 1769916008, 1769916009)\n- Queue depth: Restored 1 \u2192 4 tasks (optimal)\n\
    \nStrategic Assessment:\n- System health: 9.0/10 (Excellent)\n- Strategic shift:\
    \ 90% \u2192 100% (after next 2 runs)\n- Queue depth: 4 tasks (optimal) \u2705\
    \n- Skill consideration: 100% (validated) \u2705\n- Feature delivery: Ready to\
    \ start (framework operational)\n\nQueue Status: 4 tasks (OPTIMAL)\n- TASK-1769916006:\
    \ Feature Backlog Research (HIGH, research, 45min)\n- TASK-1769916007: Multi-Agent\
    \ Coordination (HIGH, feature, 180min)\n- TASK-1769916008: Fix Queue Sync Automation\
    \ (MEDIUM, fix, 30min)\n- TASK-1769916009: Feature Idea Generation (MEDIUM, research,\
    \ 45min)\n\nSystem Health: 9.0/10 (Excellent)\n\nNext Loop (12): Monitor task\
    \ execution, prepare for feature delivery era\n\nNext Review: Loop 20 (after 9\
    \ more loops)\n"
