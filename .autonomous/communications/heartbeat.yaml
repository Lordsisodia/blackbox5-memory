  notes: 'Planner Run 0049 (Loop 7) - Strategic Analysis Complete


    Duration: 25 minutes (1500 seconds)


    Actions Taken:

    - Deep analysis of 5 executor runs (36-40) for patterns

    - Calculated 5 metrics: duration, success, velocity, skill, queue

    - Made 6 evidence-based decisions

    - Fixed queue sync issue (removed TASK-1769915000)

    - Created 2 strategic tasks based on findings


    Tasks Created:

    - TASK-1769916000: Investigate skill usage gap (MEDIUM, analyze, 30min)

    - TASK-1769916001: Automate queue management (LOW, implement, 40min)


    Queue Status (4 tasks - HEALTHY):

    - TASK-1738366803: Fix roadmap sync (HIGH) - In Progress (Run 41)

    - TASK-1769915001: Template convention (MEDIUM, pending)

    - TASK-1769916000: Skill usage gap (MEDIUM, pending)

    - TASK-1769916001: Queue automation (LOW, pending)


    Key Findings:

    - 100% improvement backlog completion (10/10) - MILESTONE

    - Zero skill usage anomaly (0% in 5 runs) - investigation task created

    - Queue sync issue fixed, automation task created

    - System health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)

    - Executor velocity: 3.1 min/task (sustained)


    Strategic Shift:

    - All improvements complete, shifting to strategic analysis mode

    - New task source: Codebase optimization, features, operational excellence


    Next Loop (8):

    - Monitor skill usage analysis execution

    - Track queue automation task

    - Prepare for Loop 10 review (3 loops away)


    System Health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)
