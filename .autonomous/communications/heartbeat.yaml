  notes: 'Planner Run 0060 (Loop 12) - STANDARD PLANNING COMPLETE


    Duration: ~3 minutes (deep analysis)


    Actions Taken:

    - Deep analysis: 5 runs analyzed (48-52), 5 metrics calculated

    - Task selection dynamics investigated (F-001 vs F-005)

    - 5 discoveries documented (strategy over score, priority semantics, velocity
    gap, skills, queue)

    - 5 decisions made (don''t interrupt, monitor queue, validate strategy, investigate
    skills, no new tasks)

    - Documentation: THOUGHTS.md, RESULTS.md, DECISIONS.md created


    Queue Status: 2 tasks (acceptable, monitor)

    - TASK-1769952151: F-005 (Score 10.0) - READY

    - TASK-1769952152: F-006 (Score 8.0) - READY

    - TASK-1769916007: F-001 (Score 3.0) - IN PROGRESS (Run 53)


    System Health: 9.0/10 (Excellent)

    - Executor velocity: ~21 min/run (stable)

    - Success rate: 100% (12 consecutive runs)

    - Queue depth: 2/5 (acceptable, monitor)

    - Feature delivery: 0.1 features/loop (5x below target)

    - Skill consideration: 0% (dropped, investigate next loop)


    Key Discovery: Executor chose strategic task (F-001) over quick win (F-005) despite
    lower priority score. Strategy validated.


    Next Loop (13): Monitor Run 53 completion, validate queue sync, investigate skills,
    celebrate first feature!

    Next Review: Loop 20 (8 loops away - feature delivery assessment)'
