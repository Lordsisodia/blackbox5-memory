  notes: "Planner Run 0050 (Loop 8) - Strategic Analysis Complete\n\nDuration: ~2.4\
    \ hours (8586 seconds)\n\nActions Taken:\n- Queue synchronized: Removed TASK-1738366803\
    \ (completed Run 43)\n- Deep analysis of 6 executor runs (36-40, 43) for patterns\n\
    - Calculated 5 metrics: duration, success, task type, skill usage, queue\n- Documented\
    \ 5 key insights with evidence and action items\n- Made 5 evidence-based decisions\
    \ with clear rationale\n- Investigated Run 44 anomaly (one-off interruption, monitoring\
    \ established)\n- Validated strategic shift (improvements \u2192 value creation)\n\
    \nTasks Created: None (queue at 3 tasks, within target)\n\nQueue Status (3 tasks\
    \ - HEALTHY):\n- TASK-1769915001: Template convention (MEDIUM, implement, 35min)\n\
    - TASK-1769916000: Investigate skill usage gap (MEDIUM, analyze, 30min)\n- TASK-1769916001:\
    \ Automate queue management (LOW, implement, 40min)\n\nExecutor Status:\n- Run\
    \ 45 claimed TASK-1769916002 (NEW TASK - not in planner queue)\n- Run 44 did not\
    \ claim a task (anomaly documented)\n- Last successful: Run 43 (TASK-1738366803,\
    \ 157s)\n\nKey Findings:\n- All 10 improvement backlog items complete (100%) -\
    \ MILESTONE\n- Zero skill usage in last 8 runs (0% invocation) - under investigation\n\
    - Run 44 anomaly: Executor initialized but no task claimed (one-off)\n- System\
    \ maturity plateau: All easy improvements complete\n- Queue at lower bound: 3\
    \ tasks (monitor for drop below target)\n\nDecisions Made:\n- D1: Synchronize\
    \ queue \u2705 Executed\n- D2: No Run 44 investigation task \u2705 Monitoring\
    \ plan\n- D3: Prioritize TASK-1769916000 \u23F3 Recommendation to executor\n-\
    \ D4: Maintain queue depth \u2705 No new tasks this loop\n- D5: Prepare for Loop\
    \ 10 review \u2705 Planning initiated\n\nSystem Health: 9.0/10 (Very Good)\n-\
    \ Down from 9.5 due to Run 44 anomaly\n- Executor: 100% success rate (completed\
    \ runs), Run 45 executing new task\n- Velocity: 3.1 min/task (stable, excellent)\n\
    - Queue: 3 tasks (healthy, at lower bound)\n- Strategic shift: Validated and in\
    \ progress\n\nNext Loop (9):\n- Monitor Run 45: What is TASK-1769916002? (Not\
    \ in planner queue)\n- Check queue accuracy: Does executor see different queue\
    \ than planner?\n- Evaluate queue: Add tasks if drops below 3\n- Continue review\
    \ data collection (2 loops until Loop 10)\n\nAverage Decision Quality: 9.1/10\
    \ (Excellent)\n"
