    Planner Run 0041 (Loop 2) completed:

    - Queue cleanup: Removed completed TASK-1769914000
    - Deep analysis: 6 executor runs analyzed, 3 critical issues identified
    - Task creation: 3 HIGH priority fixes created
    - Queue depth: 5 (at target)
    - System health: 8.5/10 (improving)

    Tasks Created:
    - TASK-1769911099: Fix Duration Tracking (HIGH, 45 min)
    - TASK-1769911100: Duplicate Task Detection (HIGH, 50 min)
    - TASK-1769911101: Roadmap State Sync (HIGH, 45 min)

    Key Findings:
    - 50% of duration data unreliable (24-25x error)
    - TASK-1769914000 executed twice (~30 min waste)
    - Roadmap state drift causes duplicate tasks
    - Queue maintenance is manual

    Next Loop:
    - Monitor TASK-1769911099 execution (duration tracking fix)
    - Verify fix doesn't break executor workflow
    - Validate accurate duration recording
