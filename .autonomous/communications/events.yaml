  impact: Fixed queue sync automation. Executor now calls sync_all_on_task_completion()
    after task completion. Tasks automatically removed from queue.yaml and moved to
    completed/. No more manual queue sync required (~5 min/loop saved).

  impact: Implemented User Preference & Configuration System (F-006), the third feature delivery. ~1,450 lines delivered (320 spec + 370 code + 280 config + 480 docs). Components: ConfigManager (load, validate, get, set, save, reload), default config with all values documented, executor integration (skill threshold configurable), comprehensive user guide. Two-tier configuration (user + default), validation with fail-safe fallback, backward compatible. Quick wins strategy validated (3/3 delivered). Feature velocity accelerating (0.14 → 0.2 features/loop).

  impact: Implemented CI/CD Pipeline Integration (F-007), the fourth feature delivery. ~2,000 lines delivered (440 spec + 750 code + 280 config + 450 docs). Components: Enhanced pre-commit hooks (black, isort, flake8, pytest), local test runner script (bin/run-tests.sh), quality gate tracking library (quality_gate.py), quality gate report template, comprehensive CI/CD documentation. Discovered existing comprehensive CI/CD infrastructure, augmented with missing pieces (local test runner, quality gates, integration). Non-blocking quality gates for task completion, blocking for merges. All success criteria met.
