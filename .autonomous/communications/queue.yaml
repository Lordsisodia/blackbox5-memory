    title: Monitor Skill System Validation
    priority: medium
    estimated_minutes: 30
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Validate that Step 2.5 (Skill Checking) integration from TASK-1769916002 is
      working effectively. Monitor the next 3 executor runs to ensure 100% skill
      consideration rate and track invocation patterns.
    files_to_modify:
      - knowledge/analysis/skill-validation-analysis-20260201.md (create)
      - operations/skill-selection.yaml (possibly, for threshold tuning)
    acceptance_criteria:
      - 3 executor runs analyzed (Runs 46-48)
      - Skill consideration rate calculated (target: 100%)
      - Skill invocation rate calculated (target: 10-30%)
      - Analysis document created with data tables
      - Effectiveness documented with recommendations
      - Follow-up task created if rates below target

    Planner Run 0053 Queue Update:
    - Verified queue synchronization (already accurate)
    - Upgraded TASK-1769916001 priority (LOW → MEDIUM)
    - Validated skill system (100% consideration rate)
    - Analyzed Runs 44-46 for patterns
    - Maintained queue depth (3 tasks, within target)

    Current Queue (3 tasks - BOTTOM OF TARGET):
    1. TASK-1769916003: Skill Validation (MEDIUM, analyze, 30min)
       - Validates Step 2.5 integration, monitors Runs 46-48
    2. TASK-1769916001: Queue Automation (MEDIUM, implement, 40min)
       - Prevents sync issues - PRIORITY UPGRADED
    3. TASK-1769916004: Feature Framework (MEDIUM, implement, 45min)
       - Enables strategic shift, establishes new task source

    Recent Completions (Last 3 Runs):
    - Run 44: Skill usage gap investigation (368s, TASK-1769916000)
    - Run 45: Add Phase 1.5 to executor prompt (80s, TASK-1769916002)
    - Run 46: Template convention enforcement (7929s, TASK-1769915001)

    Executor Status:
    - Run 46: COMPLETED (15:50:00Z, 7929 seconds)
    - Run 47: INITIALIZED (awaiting task claim)
    - Skill system: VALIDATED (100% consideration rate in Run 46)
    - Health: EXCELLENT (4 consecutive successful runs)

    System Health: 8.5/10 (Good)
    - Executor velocity: ~46.5 min/task (high variance due to documentation)
    - Success rate: 100% (3/3 runs completed)
    - Skill system: VALIDATED (100% consideration)
    - Queue depth: 3 tasks (bottom of target, after sync)
    - Strategic shift: In progress (improvements → features)

    Next Actions:
    1. Monitor skill validation (TASK-1769916003, Runs 46-48)
    2. Implement queue automation (TASK-1769916001, MEDIUM priority)
    3. Establish feature framework (TASK-1769916004)
    4. Monitor queue depth (add tasks if drops below 3)

    Planner Run 0053 Decisions:
    - D1: Queue synchronized (removed completed tasks)
    - D2: TASK-1769916001 priority upgraded (LOW → MEDIUM)
    - D3: Queue depth maintained (3 tasks, no new tasks needed)
    - D4: Skill system validated (100% consideration rate)
    - D5: Duration estimation guidelines documented (action item)
