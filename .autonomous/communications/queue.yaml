    approach: |
      Critical finding from TASK-1769903001: Zero skill usage across 5 runs despite
      31 skills documented. Bridge the gap between skill documentation and execution.

      1. Update RALF executor prompt with explicit skill-checking workflow
      2. Add skill invocation decision tree to task execution flow
      3. Create skill-selection.yaml with decision criteria
      4. Add skill usage validation to task completion checklist
      5. Test with 3 tasks requiring different skills

    acceptance_criteria:
      - Executor prompt updated with skill-checking workflow
      - Skill selection decision tree documented
      - Skill usage validation added to completion checklist
      - At least 3 skills invoked in test tasks
      - Skill effectiveness metrics updated with usage data

    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Analyze executor THOUGHTS.md files from recent runs to understand
      decision-making patterns. Identify why skills are not being invoked
      despite clear documentation. Look for:
      1. Task type classification accuracy
      2. Skill keyword detection patterns
      3. Confidence threshold application
      4. Alternative approaches taken instead of skills

      Document findings and recommend executor prompt improvements.
