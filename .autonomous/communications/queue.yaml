    title: Enforce Template File Naming Convention
    priority: medium
    estimated_minutes: 35
    context_level: 2
    improvement: IMP-1769903005
    approach: |
      Implement and enforce template file naming convention to prevent confusion
      and reduce false bug reports. Document convention, update agent instructions,
      validate existing templates follow convention.
    files_to_modify:
      - .docs/template-system-guide.md
      - STATE.yaml
      - ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
      - All .template files (audit and ensure compliance)
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Template file naming convention documented
      - Convention added to .docs/ system for visibility
      - Templates renamed to follow convention (if needed)
      - Template system guide created or updated
      - CLAUDE.md updated with template handling rules

    title: Investigate Skill Usage Gap
    priority: medium
    estimated_minutes: 30
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Investigate why skill invocation rate is 0% in the last 5 executor runs (36-40)
      despite significant skill system investments. Analyze 10+ runs, calculate
      consideration vs invocation rates, identify root cause, recommend action.
    files_to_modify:
      - runs/executor/run-0030/THOUGHTS.md through run-0040/THOUGHTS.md
      - operations/skill-selection.yaml
      - operations/skill-metrics.yaml
      - knowledge/analysis/skill-usage-gap-analysis-20260201.md (create)
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Root cause of 0% skill usage identified
      - 10+ runs analyzed for patterns
      - Skill consideration vs invocation rate calculated
      - Evidence-based recommendation provided
      - Fix task created if needed, rationale documented if OK

    title: Automate Queue Management
    priority: low
    estimated_minutes: 40
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Implement automatic synchronization between active/ directory and queue.yaml
      to prevent sync issues. Create queue_sync.py library, integrate into task
      completion workflow, test with 2+ completions.
    files_to_modify:
      - 2-engine/.autonomous/lib/queue_sync.py (create)
      - 2-engine/.autonomous/lib/roadmap_sync.py (integrate)
      - .autonomous/communications/queue.yaml (test)
      - operations/.docs/queue-management-guide.md (create)
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Queue sync library created
      - Integration point added to workflow
      - Completed tasks auto-removed from queue
      - Test with 2+ task completions
      - No manual queue management needed
