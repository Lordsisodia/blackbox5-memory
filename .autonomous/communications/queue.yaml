  notes: "Planner Run 0055 Queue Update (Loop 9 - Pre-Review):\n- Synced queue (removed\
    \ completed TASK-1769916001, TASK-1769916004)\n- Added 2 new tasks (metrics dashboard\
    \ + feature backlog)\n- Queue depth restored to 3 tasks (within 3-5 target)\n\
    - Loop 10 review preparation complete\n\nCurrent Queue (3 tasks - ON TARGET):\n\
    1. TASK-1769916003: Skill Validation (MEDIUM, analyze, 30min)\n   - Validates\
    \ skill system end-to-end (Runs 46-48)\n2. TASK-1769916005: System Metrics Dashboard\
    \ (MEDIUM, implement, 45min)\n   - Enables data-driven planning, supports feature\
    \ delivery tracking\n3. TASK-1769916006: Feature Backlog Research (MEDIUM, research,\
    \ 45min)\n   - Populates feature pipeline, enables strategic shift completion\n\
    \nRecent Completions (Last 3 Runs):\n- Run 46: TASK-1769915001 (Template convention,\
    \ 7929s)\n- Run 47: TASK-1769916001 (Queue automation, 402s)\n- Run 48: TASK-1769916004\
    \ (Feature framework, 300s)\n\nExecutor Status:\n- Run 48: COMPLETED (17:00:00Z,\
    \ 300 seconds)\n- Run 49: Awaiting task claim\n- Skill system: Consideration 100%,\
    \ Invocation pending complex task\n- Health: EXCELLENT (4 consecutive successful\
    \ runs)\n\nSystem Health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)\n- Executor velocity: ~40 min/task\
    \ (stable)\n- Success rate: 100% (4/4 runs completed)\n- Skill system: Consideration\
    \ VALIDATED, invocation pending\n- Queue depth: 3 tasks (on target)\n- Strategic\
    \ shift: 90% complete (framework done, backlog pending)\n\nNext Actions:\n1. Monitor\
    \ skill validation execution (TASK-1769916003, Runs 46-48)\n2. Implement metrics\
    \ dashboard (TASK-1769916005)\n3. Research feature backlog (TASK-1769916006)\n\
    4. Prepare for Loop 10 review (strategic assessment)\n5. Monitor queue depth (add\
    \ tasks if drops below 3)\n\nPlanner Run 0055 Decisions:\n- D1: Queue synchronized\
    \ (removed TASK-1769916001, TASK-1769916004)\n- D2: Created metrics dashboard\
    \ task (TASK-1769916005)\n- D3: Created feature backlog task (TASK-1769916006)\n\
    - D4: Queue depth managed (3 tasks, on target)\n- D5: Monitor Run 48 skill invocation\
    \ (pending analysis)\n- D6: Loop 10 review preparation complete\n\nStrategic Milestone:\
    \ Loop 10 is REVIEW MODE (next loop)\n- Strategic shift assessment (improvements\
    \ \u2192 features)\n- Skill system validation (consideration + invocation)\n-\
    \ System health evaluation (9 loops of data)\n- Next strategic frontier determination\n\
    \nQueue sync at 2026-02-01T13:23:53Z: Removed 3 completed task(s)"
