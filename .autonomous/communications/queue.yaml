    title: Implement Automatic Roadmap State Synchronization
    priority: high
    estimated_minutes: 45
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Implement automatic sync between task completion and STATE.yaml.
      Post-task-completion hook updates plan status, unblocks dependents,
      updates next_action. Prevents roadmap drift.
    files_to_modify:
      - 2-engine/.autonomous/lib/roadmap_sync.py
      - 2-engine/.autonomous/prompts/system/executor/variations/v2-legacy-based.md
      - operations/.docs/roadmap-sync-guide.md
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Roadmap sync library created
      - Plan status auto-updates on task completion
      - Dependent plans auto-unblocked
      - next_action auto-updated
      - Tested with 2+ plan completions

    title: Make Pre-Execution Research Mandatory
    priority: high
    estimated_minutes: 35
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Make pre-execution research mandatory in Executor workflow to prevent
      duplicate work, validate assumptions, and improve task quality. Create
      research checklist, integrate into workflow, enforce compliance.
    files_to_modify:

      - 2-engine/.autonomous/templates/research-template.md
      - operations/.docs/pre-execution-research-guide.md
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Pre-execution research added to Executor workflow as REQUIRED step
      - Research checklist created (5-7 items)
      - Executor cannot skip research step
      - Research findings logged to THOUGHTS.md
      - Tested with 3+ tasks to verify compliance

    title: Add Shellcheck to CI/CD Pipeline
    priority: low
    estimated_minutes: 40
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Integrate shellcheck into CI/CD pipeline to catch shell script syntax errors.
      Add shellcheck job to ci.yml, fix any warnings in bin/ scripts,
      create shell script standards documentation.
    files_to_modify:
      - .github/workflows/ci.yml
      - bin/*.sh
      - operations/.docs/shell-script-standards.md
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Shellcheck integrated into CI/CD
      - All bin/ scripts pass shellcheck
      - Shell script standards documented

    title: Implement Plan Validation Before Execution
    priority: medium
    estimated_minutes: 40
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Create plan validation system that checks if referenced files exist and
      problems are still valid before marking plans as ready_to_start. Prevents
      wasted effort on invalid or stale plans.
    files_to_modify:
      - 2-engine/.autonomous/lib/plan_validator.py
      - 2-engine/.autonomous/workflows/plan-approval.yaml
      - plans/.docs/plan-validation-guide.md
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Plan validation script created
      - Checks all files_to_change exist
      - Verifies problem statement against current codebase
      - Integration with plan approval workflow
      - Auto-fail plans with invalid references
