    title: Fix Roadmap Sync Integration Gap
    priority: high
    estimated_minutes: 20
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Fix the roadmap sync integration gap where improvement-backlog.yaml is not
      automatically updated when tasks are completed. Extend roadmap_sync.py to
      update improvement backlog, integrate into Executor workflow, manually fix
      stale statuses.
    files_to_modify:
      - 2-engine/.autonomous/lib/roadmap_sync.py
      - 2-engine/.autonomous/prompts/system/executor/variations/v2-legacy-based.md
      - operations/improvement-backlog.yaml
    acceptance_criteria:
      - roadmap_sync.py extended to update improvement-backlog.yaml
      - Integration point added to Executor workflow
      - improvement-backlog.yaml auto-updates on task completion
      - Test with 2+ task completions to verify sync works
      - Manual update of stale improvements (4 HIGH priority marked complete)
