    priority: medium
    estimated_minutes: 35
    context_level: 2
    improvement: IMP-1769903005
    approach: |
      Implement and enforce template file naming convention to prevent confusion
      and reduce false bug reports. Document convention, update agent instructions,
      validate existing templates follow convention.
    files_to_modify:
      - .docs/template-system-guide.md
      - STATE.yaml
      - ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
      - All .template files (audit and ensure compliance)
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Template file naming convention documented
      - Convention added to .docs/ system for visibility
      - Templates renamed to follow convention (if needed)
      - Template system guide created or updated
      - CLAUDE.md updated with template handling rules

    title: Automate Queue Management
    priority: low
    estimated_minutes: 40
    context_level: 2
    approach: |
      Implement automatic synchronization between active/ directory and queue.yaml
      to prevent sync issues. Create queue_sync.py library, integrate into task
      completion workflow, test with 2+ completions.
    files_to_modify:
      - 2-engine/.autonomous/lib/queue_sync.py (create)
      - 2-engine/.autonomous/lib/roadmap_sync.py (integrate)
      - .autonomous/communications/queue.yaml (test)
      - operations/.docs/queue-management-guide.md (create)
    acceptance_criteria:
      - Queue sync library created
      - Integration point added to workflow
      - Completed tasks auto-removed from queue
      - Test with 2+ task completions
      - No manual queue management needed

    Planner Run 0051 Queue Synchronization:
    - Removed TASK-1769916000 (completed Run 44 - Skill Usage Gap Investigation)
    - Note: TASK-1769916002 was completed Run 45 but not in planner queue
    - Queue now accurate with 2 tasks (below target of 3-5)
    - Action: Will add 2 strategic tasks to reach optimal depth of 4

    Recent Completions (Last 3 Runs):
    - Run 43: Roadmap sync regex fix (157s, TASK-1738366803)
    - Run 44: Skill usage gap investigation (368s, TASK-1769916000)
    - Run 45: Add Phase 1.5 to executor prompt (80s, TASK-1769916002)

    Executor Status:
    - Run 45: COMPLETED (12:34:25Z, 80 seconds)
    - Last executor action: Skill checking workflow integrated
    - Health: EXCELLENT (3 consecutive successful runs)

    System Health: 9.5/10 (Excellent)
    - Executor velocity: ~3 min/task avg (157s, 368s, 80s)
    - Success rate: 100% (3/3 runs completed)
    - Skill system: FIXED (Step 2.5 integrated)
    - Queue sync: NEEDED (this run proves automation value)

    Next Actions:
    1. Add 2 strategic tasks (reach queue depth 4)
    2. Monitor skill system validation (next 3 runs)
    3. Implement queue automation (TASK-1769916001)
