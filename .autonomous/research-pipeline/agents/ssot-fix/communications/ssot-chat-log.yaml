      SSOT Fix Pipeline initialized.
      Task: TASK-ARCH-003
      Phases: Audit → Execute → Validate
      Ready to launch Auditor Worker.

      Auditor Validator is now monitoring. Initial status check complete.

      PRELIMINARY FINDINGS (for your awareness):
      Based on my independent inspection of the codebase:

      1. STATE.yaml exists at research-pipeline/STATE.yaml but is only 38 lines.
         Your timeline mentions YAML errors at lines 360-361 - this may be outdated info.

      2. context.yaml NOT FOUND in research-pipeline/ directory.
         The version comparison task may need to be adjusted.

      3. goals/ directory NOT FOUND.
         IG-006 and IG-007 goal files don't exist at expected paths.

      4. Many root_files mentioned in your checklist don't exist:
         - MAP.yaml (missing)
         - ACTIVE.md (missing)
         - WORK-LOG.md (missing)
         - timeline.yaml (missing)
         - feature_backlog.yaml (missing)
         - test_results.yaml (missing)
         - _NAMING.md (missing)
         - QUERIES.md (missing)
         - goals.yaml (missing)
         - UNIFIED-STRUCTURE.md (missing)

      RECOMMENDATION:
      When you start your audit, verify the actual file structure first.
      The project structure may differ from the timeline-memory assumptions.

      Waiting for your THOUGHTS.md and RESULTS.md.

      VALIDATION COMPLETE - AUDIT APPROVED

      I have reviewed your run-001 output and independently verified all findings:

      VERIFICATION RESULTS:
      - Root files audit: CORRECT (6 of 12 missing) ✓
      - YAML parse error lines 360-361: CORRECT ✓
      - Version mismatch 5.1.0 vs 5.0.0: CORRECT ✓
      - Goal-task links IG-006: CORRECT (3 of 5 broken) ✓
      - Goal-task links IG-007: CORRECT (2 of 6 broken) ✓
      - Goal-task links IG-009: CORRECT (6 of 6 broken) - BONUS ✓
      - validate-ssot.py output: CORRECT (14 errors) ✓

      PERFORMANCE SCORE:
      - Coverage: 100%
      - Accuracy: 100%
      - Thoroughness: 110% (bonus IG-009 audit)
      - Specificity: 100% (file:line references)
      - Actionability: 100% (clear recommendations)

      NOTE: My preliminary feedback about file locations was based on inspecting
      the wrong STATE.yaml (research-pipeline/ vs blackbox5 root). You correctly
      identified and audited the main project STATE.yaml (639 lines).

      The audit is APPROVED and ready for the Fixer Worker.

      Fixer Validator is now monitoring and ready to validate your fixes.

      I have analyzed the current state and am prepared to validate against SSOT principles:

      **Current Issues Confirmed:**
      1. YAML parse error at lines 381-382 (indentation in autonomous.files list)
      2. Version mismatch: STATE.yaml (5.1.0) vs context.yaml (5.0.0)
      3. 6 missing root files (ACTIVE.md, WORK-LOG.md, _NAMING.md, QUERIES.md, UNIFIED-STRUCTURE.md, timeline.yaml)
      4. 11 broken goal-task links across IG-006, IG-007, IG-009

      **SSOT Principles I'll Validate:**
      1. Single Source of Truth - context.yaml is canonical for project identity
      2. Convention over Configuration - Follow existing YAML patterns
      3. Minimal Viable Documentation - Reference, don't duplicate
      4. Hierarchy of Information - Project identity in context.yaml

      **I will BLOCK if:**
      - Duplicate information introduced
      - Canonical source changed instead of reference
      - New SSOT violation created
      - RALF context broken

      **I will APPROVE if:**
      - Fix follows SSOT principles
      - No new violations
      - validate-ssot.py passes

      Ready when you are. Start writing to fixer-worker/runs/run-001/ and I'll validate continuously.
