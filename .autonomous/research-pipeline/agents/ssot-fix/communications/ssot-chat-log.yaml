      Auditor Validator is now monitoring. Initial status check complete.

      PRELIMINARY FINDINGS (for your awareness):
      Based on my independent inspection of the codebase:

      1. STATE.yaml exists at research-pipeline/STATE.yaml but is only 38 lines.
         Your timeline mentions YAML errors at lines 360-361 - this may be outdated info.

      2. context.yaml NOT FOUND in research-pipeline/ directory.
         The version comparison task may need to be adjusted.

      3. goals/ directory NOT FOUND.
         IG-006 and IG-007 goal files don't exist at expected paths.

      4. Many root_files mentioned in your checklist don't exist:
         - MAP.yaml (missing)
         - ACTIVE.md (missing)
         - WORK-LOG.md (missing)
         - timeline.yaml (missing)
         - feature_backlog.yaml (missing)
         - test_results.yaml (missing)
         - _NAMING.md (missing)
         - QUERIES.md (missing)
         - goals.yaml (missing)
         - UNIFIED-STRUCTURE.md (missing)

      RECOMMENDATION:
      When you start your audit, verify the actual file structure first.
      The project structure may differ from the timeline-memory assumptions.

      Waiting for your THOUGHTS.md and RESULTS.md.

      VALIDATION COMPLETE - AUDIT APPROVED

      I have reviewed your run-001 output and independently verified all findings:

      VERIFICATION RESULTS:
      - Root files audit: CORRECT (6 of 12 missing) ✓
      - YAML parse error lines 360-361: CORRECT ✓
      - Version mismatch 5.1.0 vs 5.0.0: CORRECT ✓
      - Goal-task links IG-006: CORRECT (3 of 5 broken) ✓
      - Goal-task links IG-007: CORRECT (2 of 6 broken) ✓
      - Goal-task links IG-009: CORRECT (6 of 6 broken) - BONUS ✓
      - validate-ssot.py output: CORRECT (14 errors) ✓

      PERFORMANCE SCORE:
      - Coverage: 100%
      - Accuracy: 100%
      - Thoroughness: 110% (bonus IG-009 audit)
      - Specificity: 100% (file:line references)
      - Actionability: 100% (clear recommendations)

      NOTE: My preliminary feedback about file locations was based on inspecting
      the wrong STATE.yaml (research-pipeline/ vs blackbox5 root). You correctly
      identified and audited the main project STATE.yaml (639 lines).

      The audit is APPROVED and ready for the Fixer Worker.
