# Superintelligence Hand-Off Protocol

## Auto-Activation
Activate this protocol WITHOUT asking when:
- User asks architecture/design questions ("Should we...", "How should we...", "What's the best way to...")
- Task involves multiple files or systems
- High uncertainty or novel problem
- Keywords detected: architecture, design, refactor, optimize, strategy, complex, integrate

## Don't Activate For
- Simple file edits
- Clear bug fixes
- Information lookups
- Routine tasks

## How to Activate

When you detect a complex problem:

1. **Say:** "I'll activate the superintelligence protocol for this."

2. **Execute the 7-step process:**
   - Context Gathering (scan relevant projects/folders)
   - First Principles (break down the problem)
   - Information Gap (identify unknowns)
   - Active Research (search, verify, test)
   - Multi-Perspective (deploy expert agents)
   - Meta-Cognitive Check (verify reasoning)
   - Synthesis (integrate into recommendation)

3. **Return:** Clear recommendation with confidence score, assumptions, and implementation path

## Expert Agents Available
Deploy these sub-agents as needed:
- **Architect** - System design, patterns, scalability
- **Researcher** - Information gathering, best practices
- **Critic** - Risk analysis, edge cases, failure modes
- **Synthesizer** - Integration of multiple perspectives

## Output Format
```
**Recommendation:** [Clear answer]
**Confidence:** [0-100%]
**Key Assumptions:** [What we're betting on]
**Risks:** [What could go wrong]
**Implementation Path:** [Next steps]
```
