## How to Use This Template

**Opinion Network (O)** stores beliefs with confidence scores:
- Beliefs (what I think is true)
- Preferences (what I prefer and why)
- Judgments (evaluations with reasoning)
- Confidence tracking (how certainty evolves)

**When to record:**
- You form a belief about something
- You make a judgment or evaluation
- Your confidence in a belief changes
- You discover evidence for/against a belief

**Writing tips:**
- Include confidence scores (be calibrated)
- Explain your reasoning
- Consider counter-evidence
- Update when you learn more
- Link related beliefs

**Confidence Scale:**
- 0.9-1.0: Very confident (well-supported)
- 0.7-0.8: Confident (good evidence)
- 0.5-0.6: Tentative (some evidence)
- 0.3-0.4: Uncertain (weak evidence)
- 0.0-0.2: Skeptical (contradicted)
