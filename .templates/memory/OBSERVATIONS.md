## Key Insights

### S-001: [Insight Title]

**Type:** [pattern/synthesis/anomaly/prediction]
**Confidence:** [0.0-1.0]
**Significance:** [high/medium/low]

**Insight:**
> The synthesized insight - what does it all mean?

**Synthesis:**
- From: [What sources/facts/experiences led to this]
- Pattern: [What pattern was observed]
- Implication: [What this means going forward]

**Evidence Base:**
- Facts: [F-XXX, F-XXX]
- Experiences: [E-XXX, E-XXX]
- Opinions: [O-XXX]

**Implications:**
1. [What follows from this insight]
2. [Another implication]

**Actionable:**
- Do: [Specific action to take]
- Avoid: [What to watch out for]
- Watch: [What to monitor]

## Patterns Detected

### Pattern: [Pattern Name]

**Description:**
> What pattern was observed?

**Occurrences:**
| Instance | When | Context | Confidence |
|----------|------|---------|------------|
| 1 | {{DATE}} | [Context] | 0.8 |
| 2 | {{DATE}} | [Context] | 0.7 |

**Generalization:**
> Under what conditions does this pattern hold?

**Exceptions:**
- [When does this pattern NOT apply?]

**Predictive Power:**
- If [condition], then [prediction]

## Cross-Task Insights

### Connection: [Topic]

**Related Work:**
- Task: [TASK-XXX]
- Finding: [What was discovered]
- Relevance: [How it relates to current task]

**Synthesis:**
> What do multiple tasks tell us about this topic?

**Emergent Pattern:**
> What becomes clear when looking across tasks?

---

## Anomalies & Surprises

### A-001: [Anomaly Description]

**Expected:**
> What did I expect to happen?

**Actual:**
> What actually happened?

**Significance:**
- Why it matters: [...]
- What it might indicate: [...]

**Investigation:**
- Hypotheses: [...]
- Tests: [...]
- Current thinking: [...]

## Strategic Observations

### Strategic: [Observation Title]

**Context:**
> The broader situation

**Observation:**
> What was noticed about strategy/approach

**Recommendation:**
> What should be done differently

**Rationale:**
> Why this recommendation makes sense

## How to Use This Template

**Observation Network (S)** stores synthesized insights:
- Key insights (what does it all mean?)
- Patterns (recurring themes across work)
- Cross-task connections (how does this relate to past work?)
- Anomalies (surprises and exceptions)
- Strategic observations (big picture learnings)

**When to record:**
- You notice a pattern across multiple items
- You synthesize information into insight
- Something surprises you
- You connect current work to past work
- You have a "big picture" realization

**Writing tips:**
- Synthesize, don't just summarize
- Connect to evidence (cite Facts/Experiences/Opinions)
- Consider implications
- Look for patterns across tasks
- Record anomalies - they're often important

**Synthesis vs Summary:**
- Summary: "I read 3 papers about memory"
- Synthesis: "Memory systems converge on hybrid architectures because..."
