## How to Use This Template

**Experience Network (B)** stores first-person actions and experiences:
- Actions taken (what I did, step by step)
- Learning moments (challenges overcome)
- Tool usage (commands, APIs, techniques)
- Interactions (questions asked, feedback received)

**When to record:**
- You complete a significant action
- You learn something new
- You encounter and solve a problem
- You use a tool or technique

**Writing tips:**
- Use first person ("I did...", "I learned...")
- Be specific about steps taken
- Include the "why" not just the "what"
- Record both successes and failures
