# TASK-1738300332: Fix Skills System Critical Issues

**Status:** in_progress
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Created:** 2026-01-31T04:25:00Z
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Project:** RALF-CORE
**Generated By:** goal-cascade
**Parent Plan:** PLAN-001 (Skills System Audit & Consolidation)

---

## Objective

Execute the initial audit of the three skills systems (skills-cap/, .skills-new/, and skills/) to determine which canonical system to maintain. This is the critical first step that will enable:
- Agent skill attachment functionality
- Removal of 33 duplicate skills
- Path resolution for SkillManager
- Unblocking of dependent plans (PLAN-002, PLAN-003)

## Success Criteria

- [x] Audit completed: Count skills in each of the three systems
- [x] Quality comparison: Compare skill quality across systems
- [x] Consolidation decision: Determine which system becomes canonical
- [x] Decision recorded: Document rationale in decision_registry.yaml
- [x] Path forward: Clear migration plan documented

## Completion

**Completed:** 2026-01-31T04:27:32Z
**Run Folder:** /Users/shaansisodia/.blackbox5/5-project-memory/ralf-core/.autonomous/runs/run-1769808452
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Path Used:** Quick Flow (Discovery Phase Only)
**Status:** COMPLETE - NO ACTION NEEDED

### Key Findings

1. **Only ONE skills system exists:** `~/.blackbox5/2-engine/.autonomous/skills/`
2. **No duplicate skills found:** The PLAN-001 document references directories (skills-cap/, .skills-new/) that don't exist in the current codebase
3. **SkillRouter working correctly:** Correctly references the skills/ directory
4. **Previous task completed:** TASK-20260130-001 already addressed skills system on 2026-01-30

### Recommendation

**PLAN-001 should be marked as COMPLETED or REMOVED** from the roadmap, as it describes an issue that no longer exists in the current codebase structure.

## Context

### Source Analysis
- **Goal Reference:** PLAN-001 from roadmap
- **Roadmap Status:** Critical priority, blocking multiple downstream plans
- **Technical Debt:** 33 duplicate skills across three systems
- **Impact:** Agent skill attachment feature is blocked

### Root Cause
From roadmap analysis:
```
PLAN-001: Skills System Critical Issues
- Priority: Critical
- Status: Ready to execute
- Estimated Effort: 1-2 days
- Blocks: PLAN-002, PLAN-003
```

## Approach

### Phase 1: Discovery (QUICK-SPEC)
1. Locate all three skills directories
2. Count skills in each directory
3. Compare skill completeness and quality
4. Identify unique skills in each system

### Phase 2: Analysis
1. Evaluate skill structure and metadata
2. Check which system has the most complete implementations
3. Assess which system has better documentation
4. Identify migration complexity

### Phase 3: Decision
1. Select canonical skills system
2. Document decision with reversibility assessment
3. Create migration plan for non-canonical systems
4. Record in decision_registry.yaml

### Phase 4: Execute (if time permits)
1. Begin consolidation process
2. Migrate unique skills to canonical system
3. Remove duplicate skills
4. Update SkillManager paths

## Risk Level

**MEDIUM** - This involves core system configuration but changes are reversible with proper documentation.

## Rollback Strategy

1. All three skills systems remain in place until consolidation is complete
2. Decision registry will record the rationale for selection
3. Git commits will be atomic per migration step
4. Can revert to any previous state if issues arise

## Decision Framework

```yaml
options_considered:
  - id: "OPT-001"
    description: "Keep skills-cap/ as canonical"
    pros: ["Currently active", "Some skills already integrated"]
    cons: ["May have incomplete implementations"]
  - id: "OPT-002"
    description: "Keep .skills-new/ as canonical"
    pros: ["May have improved structure", "Newer implementations"]
    cons: ["May be incomplete", "Hidden directory"]
  - id: "OPT-003"
    description: "Keep skills/ as canonical"
    pros: ["Standard location", "Clean naming"]
    cons: ["May be older implementations"]
```

## Next Steps

1. Begin audit immediately
2. Complete analysis within 30 minutes
3. Make consolidation decision
4. Document and record
5. If time permits, begin migration
