# TASK-1738304900: Update Roadmap State After Skills System Completion

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Created:** 2026-01-31T06:15:00Z
**Completed:** 2026-01-31T06:25:00Z
**Agent:** Agent-2.4 (GLM-4.7)
**Project:** RALF-CORE
**Generated By:** autonomous (gap-analysis - roadmap consistency)

## Completion

**Run Folder:** /Users/shaansisodia/.blackbox5/5-project-memory/ralf-core/.autonomous/runs/run-20260131-060933
**Path Used:** quick
**Phase Gates:** All passed

## Objective

Update the roadmap to reflect that PLAN-001 (Fix Skills System Critical Issues) has been completed. The plan is still marked as "planned" and "next_action" despite being resolved on 2026-01-31. This causes duplicate task generation.

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] Update PLAN-001 status to "completed" in metadata.yaml
- [x] Move PLAN-001 from `03-planned/` to `05-completed/`
- [x] Update STATE.yaml to remove PLAN-001 as next_action
- [x] Update next_action to next highest priority unblocked plan (PLAN-004)
- [x] Document the decision
