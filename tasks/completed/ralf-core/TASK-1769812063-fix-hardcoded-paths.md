# TASK-1769812063: Fix Hardcoded Paths Breaking Agent-2.3 Multi-Project Access

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2026-01-31T05:26:03Z
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Project:** RALF-CORE
**Generated By:** gap-analysis

---

## Objective

Fix hardcoded paths in `critical-paths.md` and 30 other files that break Agent-2.3's multi-project memory access. The files reference the old location `~/.blackbox5/` but the actual current location is `~/.blackbox5/` (expands to `/Users/shaansisodia/.blackbox5/`).

## Success Criteria

- [x] All 35 affected files updated to use `~/.blackbox5/` notation
- [x] `critical-paths.md` paths verified correct
- [x] Python files use `~/.blackbox5/` notation (system standard)
- [x] Git commits created with atomic changes (2 commits)
- [x] No regressions - 0 old paths remain

## Context

### Source Analysis
- **Gap Identified:** critical-paths.md and 30 other files contain hardcoded paths with old location
- **Impact:** Agent-2.3 cannot access multi-project memory, breaking a key feature of the Integration release
- **Research Findings:**
  - 28 markdown files affected
  - 3 Python files affected:
    - `2-engine/tests/unit/test_managerial_agent.py`
    - `2-engine/modules/fractal_genesis/data/storage.py`
    - `2-engine/core/agents/definitions/managerial/memory/management_memory.py`
  - System is designed to use `~/.blackbox5/` notation (see README.md and AGENT.md v2.3)
  - `BLACKBOX5_HOME="$HOME/.blackbox5"` environment variable is available

### Files Affected

From research:
- `~/.blackbox5/1-docs/04-project/critical-paths.md` - PRIMARY TARGET (Agent-2.3 dependency)
- Plus 30 other files with hardcoded paths

## Approach

**Path Selected:** Quick Flow (clear fix, single component, < 2 hours)

### Phase 1: QUICK-SPEC
- Restate goal: Fix all hardcoded paths
- List files to modify: 31 files total
- Identify tests needed: Verify paths resolve correctly
- Assess risk: LOW - simple string replacement

### Phase 2: DEV-STORY
1. Update `critical-paths.md` first (highest priority - Agent-2.3 dependency)
2. Update remaining markdown files
3. Update Python files to use `BLACKBOX5_HOME` where appropriate
4. Test: Verify paths resolve correctly
5. Commit each file type separately (markdown vs Python)

### Phase 3: CODE-REVIEW
- Self-review: All paths use `~/.blackbox5/` notation
- Verify: No old hardcoded paths remain
- Confirm: Python code uses environment variables

## Risk Level

**LOW** - Simple string replacement, no logic changes

## Rollback Strategy

Git revert if paths don't resolve correctly. Atomic commits by file type make targeted rollback easy.


## Completion

**Completed:** 2026-01-30T22:30:23Z
**Run Folder:** ~/.blackbox5/5-project-memory/ralf-core/.autonomous/runs/run-20260131_052931
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Path Used:** quick
**Phase Gates:** All passed
**Decisions Recorded:** 3

### Commits
- d7ee4da: ralf: [docs] fix hardcoded paths in critical-paths.md
- bc4a0db: ralf: [docs] fix hardcoded paths in remaining 34 files

### Results
- 35 files fixed
