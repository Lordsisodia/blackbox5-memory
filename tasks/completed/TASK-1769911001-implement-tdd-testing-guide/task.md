# TASK-1769911001: Implement TDD testing guide from IMP-1769903006

**Type:** implement
**Priority:** medium
**Status:** pending
**Created:** 2026-02-01T10:05:00Z

## Objective
Implement the TDD testing guide improvement from the improvement backlog (IMP-1769903006).

## Context
This task is derived from IMP-1769903006 which was extracted from learnings analysis. The improvement addresses the need for systematic testing guidance in the RALF workflow. Currently, testing practices vary across runs, leading to inconsistent quality.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Read IMP-1769903006 to understand full requirements
- [ ] Create operations/testing-guidelines.yaml with TDD patterns
- [ ] Create operations/.docs/testing-guide.md with practical examples
- [ ] Update .templates/tasks/task-completion.md.template with testing section
- [ ] Mark IMP-1769903006 as completed in operations/improvement-backlog.yaml

## Files to Modify
- operations/testing-guidelines.yaml (create)
- operations/.docs/testing-guide.md (create)
- .templates/tasks/task-completion.md.template (modify)
- operations/improvement-backlog.yaml (update status)

## Approach
1. Read the improvement file: .autonomous/tasks/improvements/IMP-1769903006-tdd-testing-guide.md
2. Research existing testing patterns in the codebase
3. Create comprehensive testing guidelines
4. Add testing checklist to task completion template
5. Update improvement backlog status

## Dependencies
- Access to IMP-1769903006 file for full requirements

## Notes
- Part of the improvement backlog processing initiative
- Aims to standardize testing across all executor runs
- Should integrate with existing skill system
