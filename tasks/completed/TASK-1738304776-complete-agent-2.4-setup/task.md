# TASK-1738304776: Complete Agent-2.4 Setup and Documentation System

**Status:** completed

## Objective

Complete the Agent-2.4 (Measurement Release) setup by fixing missing components and enabling the performance tracking system.

## Success Criteria

- [x] v2.4 templates directory created with decision_registry.yaml template
- [x] bin/ralf.md updated to reference Agent-2.4 (not 2.3)
- [x] ralf-metrics.jsonl initialized with header/metadata
- [x] ralf-dashboard script bug fixed (line 78 has syntax error: missing `-`)
- [x] Previous runs documentation audit completed

## Context

### Source Analysis
- **Gap Analysis Findings:**
  - v2.4 is missing `templates/decision_registry.yaml` (v2.3 has it)
  - bin/ralf.md still references Agent-2.3 instead of Agent-2.4
  - ralf-metrics.jsonl doesn't exist (required for dashboard)
  - ralf-dashboard has a syntax error on line 78 (`|` should be `| -` for jq)
  - Previous 29 runs have 0 documentation files (100% coverage gap)

- **First Principles Insight:**
  - Agent-2.4 requires 100% documentation coverage
  - Performance tracking is core to the "Measurement Release"
  - Templates are needed for decision_registry.yaml initialization

- **Critical Path Impact:**
  - Without templates, decision registry can't be initialized
  - Without metrics.jsonl, dashboard shows "no metrics yet"
  - Outdated ralf.md causes confusion about which agent is active

## Approach

1. Create v2.4 templates directory and copy decision_registry.yaml from v2.3
2. Update bin/ralf.md to reference Agent-2.4 (update version number and XP rating)
3. Initialize ralf-metrics.jsonl with initial entry/metadata
4. Fix ralf-dashboard syntax error on line 78
5. Audit previous runs and document the documentation gap

## Risk Level

LOW - File creation and text updates only, no executable code changes

## Rollback Strategy

- Delete v2.4/templates if created incorrectly
- Restore bin/ralf.md from git if needed
- Delete ralf-metrics.jsonl if initialization fails
- Revert ralf-dashboard change with git checkout
