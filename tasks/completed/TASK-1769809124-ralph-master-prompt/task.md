## Objective

Create Ralph's master system prompt file that defines the autonomous loop behavior following the Ralph Technique principles.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Master prompt file created at `2-engine/02-agents/implementations/04-specialists/4-specialists/ralph-agent/system/prompt.md`
- [ ] Prompt implements Ralph loop logic (one task per loop, context preservation, fix_plan.md tracking)
- [ ] Exit conditions properly defined ("PROMPT_COMPLETE" response)
- [ ] Integration with Blackbox5 task management system documented
- [ ] No placeholders - all tests must be functional

## Context

### Source Analysis
- **Goal Reference:** PLAN-011 (Ralph Master Prompt and Core Components)
- **Parent Goal:** Create Ralph-specific system prompt
- **Current Issue:** The manifest references a non-existent prompt.md file
- **Dependencies:** 
  - Ralph's manifest structure
  - Existing runtime integration
  - Blackbox5 task management system

### Ralph Technique Principles
1. One task per loop iteration
2. Context preservation using sub-agents
3. Progress tracking through fix_plan.md and prd.json
4. Exit conditions when "PROMPT_COMPLETE" is returned
5. No placeholders - every test must be functional

## Approach

1. **Research Phase:** Read existing Ralph manifest and integration code
2. **Design Phase:** Define prompt structure with loop logic
3. **Implementation Phase:** Create the prompt.md file
4. **Validation Phase:** Test prompt with sample loop execution

## Risk Level

MEDIUM - This is a core component that affects Ralph's behavior. Incorrect implementation could break autonomous loop execution.

## Rollback Strategy

If the prompt causes issues:
1. Revert to previous prompt version (if exists)
2. Restore from git commit
3. Review and fix based on error logs
