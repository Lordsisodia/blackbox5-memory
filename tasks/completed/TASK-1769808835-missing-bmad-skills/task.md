**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Project:** RALF-CORE
**Generated By:** gap-analysis
**Path Used:** quick

## Objective

Clarify the BMAD skills specification and resolve the ambiguous "12 skills" reference in the gap analysis.

## Success Criteria

- [x] BMAD skills specification clarified
- [x] Gap analysis table updated to reflect accurate information
- [x] Documentation updated to prevent future confusion

## Context

### Research Findings

**Current BMAD Skills (9 skills):**
1. bmad-pm.md - Product Manager (John)
2. bmad-architect.md - Architect (Winston)
3. bmad-analyst.md - Analyst (Mary)
4. bmad-dev.md - Developer (Amelia)
5. bmad-qa.md - QA Engineer (Quinn)
6. bmad-ux.md - UX Designer (Sally)
7. bmad-sm.md - Scrum Master (Bob)
8. bmad-tea.md - Test Architect (TEA)
9. bmad-quick-flow.md - Quick Flow (Barry)

**Specification Gap:**
- The gap analysis table in `ralf.md` line 411 states "12 BMAD skills" as ideal
- No BMAD documentation specifies what the "12 skills" should be
- The BMAD Integration Plan mentions 21 specialized agents, not 12 skills
- The skill router (`lib/skill_router.py`) defines exactly 9 skill roles
- All 9 skills are implemented, functional, and integrated

**Root Cause:**
The "12 skills" reference likely conflates two different systems:
- BMAD skills: 9 core roles (currently implemented)
- SISO legacy skills: 12 skills (4 core + 8 triggered in a different system)

## Approach

1. Update the gap analysis table in `ralf.md` to reflect "9 BMAD skills" as complete
2. Document the clarification to prevent future confusion
3. Close this task as resolved

## Risk Level

LOW - Documentation update only, no code changes

## Rollback Strategy

Revert documentation changes if needed

## Research Notes

The skill router defines the complete set of BMAD skill roles in the `SkillRole` enum:
```python
class SkillRole(Enum):
    PM = "pm"
    ARCHITECT = "architect"
    ANALYST = "analyst"
    SCRUM_MASTER = "sm"
    UX = "ux"
    DEV = "dev"
    QA = "qa"
    TEA = "tea"
    QUICK_FLOW = "quick"
```

This is the authoritative source for BMAD skills in the system.

## Completion

**Resolution:** The BMAD skills system is complete with 9 core skills. The "12 skills" reference in the gap analysis table was an error that conflated BMAD skills (9) with SISO legacy skills (12). Both documentation files have been updated to reflect accurate information.

**Files Modified:**
1. `bin/ralf.md` - Updated gap analysis table
2. `prompts/blackbox5.md` - Updated gap analysis table
3. `5-project-memory/ralf-core/.autonomous/tasks/active/TASK-1769808835-missing-bmad-skills.md` - Task completed
