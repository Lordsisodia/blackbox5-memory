# TASK-1738300103: Create RALF Development Workflow

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2026-01-31T04:27:00Z
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Project:** RALF-CORE
**Generated By:** telemetry-analysis

## Objective

Establish a safe development workflow for RALF autonomous operations by creating a feature branch and ensuring proper branch safety configuration.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Feature branch `feature/ralf-dev-workflow` created from main
- [x] Branch safety configuration verified to allow RALF execution
- [x] Test autonomous loop execution on new branch
- [x] Document branch workflow in RALF docs

## Context

### Source Analysis
- **Telemetry Data:** Critical error found in recent log: "On 'main' branch! RALF cannot run here."
- **First Principles Insight:** RALF requires isolated environment to safely make autonomous changes
- **Gap Identified:** No feature branch exists; RALF cannot operate on main for safety reasons
- **Goal Reference:** None active - this is infrastructure task

### Root Cause
RALF framework has hardcoded safety check preventing execution on `main` or `master` branches. This is correct behavior, but we need to create a proper development branch.

## Approach

1. Create feature branch `feature/ralf-dev-workflow`
2. Verify branch is not main/master
3. Initialize RALF run on new branch
4. Test autonomous task execution
5. Update documentation with workflow

## Risk Level

**LOW** - Creating a branch is safe and reversible

## Rollback Strategy

If anything goes wrong:
- Delete feature branch: `git branch -D feature/ralf-dev-workflow`
- Return to main: `git checkout main`
- No files modified, so no git reset needed

## Files to Read

- `~/.blackbox5/2-engine/.autonomous/prompts/ralf.md` - Verify branch safety rules
- Recent run logs for additional context
