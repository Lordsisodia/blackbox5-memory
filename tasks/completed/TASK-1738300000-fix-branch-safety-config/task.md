## Objective

Fix the mismatch between routes.yaml branch configuration (`feature/tier2-skills-integration`) and actual working branch (`main`). The telemetry system is flagging an error because RALF is configured to use a non-existent branch, but work is actually happening on main.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] routes.yaml updated to reflect actual branch strategy
- [ ] Branch safety logic clarified (when to use feature vs main)
- [ ] Telemetry check aligned with actual workflow
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Context

### Source Analysis: Telemetry Data
Recent telemetry log (`ralf-session-20260131_035653.log`) shows:
```
[ERROR] CRITICAL: On 'main' branch! RALF cannot run here.
```

However, recent commits show work IS happening on main successfully:
- `37303bf ralf: [20260131-041509] autonomous improvements`
- `13f2382 ralf: fix import path errors in server.py`

### The Problem
`routes.yaml` configures:
```yaml
github:
  branch: "feature/tier2-skills-integration"
```

But this branch doesn't exist. Only `main` exists, and work has been flowing to main.

### Root Cause Analysis
The branch safety check was designed to prevent accidental commits to main, but:
1. The configured feature branch doesn't exist
2. Actual workflow commits directly to main
3. The check is blocking without offering remediation

## Approach

1. **Quick Flow Path** - This is a config fix, not a feature

2. **PHASE 1: QUICK-SPEC**
   - Decide: Should RALF work on main or use feature branches?
   - If main: Remove the branch check error
   - If feature: Create the branch and update check logic

3. **PHASE 2: DEV-STORY**
   - Update routes.yaml or create feature branch
   - Fix the safety check logic
   - Test that new config works

4. **PHASE 3: CODE-REVIEW**
   - Verify branch strategy is consistent
   - Check for other hardcoded branch references

## Risk Level

**LOW** - Configuration-only change, no logic modification

## Rollback Strategy

Revert the single commit that updates routes.yaml and/or branch check logic
