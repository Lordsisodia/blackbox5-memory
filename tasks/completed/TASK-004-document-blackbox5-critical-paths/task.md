**Status:** completed
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Created:** 2026-01-30
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Project:** RALF-CORE

---

## Objective

Create comprehensive documentation of all Black Box 5 critical paths for Agent-2.3 reference.

## Background

Agent-2.3 includes many critical paths in the AGENT.md, but they should also be documented in a standalone reference file for easier maintenance.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Create `~/.blackbox5/1-docs/04-project/critical-paths.md`
- [x] Document all project memory paths
- [x] Document all engine component paths
- [x] Document all skill paths
- [x] Document all documentation paths
- [x] Document all roadmap paths
- [x] Keep in sync with AGENT.md

## Critical Paths to Document

### Project Memories
- RALF-CORE paths
- Blackbox5 paths
- SISO-INTERNAL paths
- Management paths

### Engine Components
- Core engine paths
- Runtime paths
- Shell script paths
- Library paths
- Skill paths
- Prompt paths

### Documentation
- Theory docs
- Implementation guides
- User guides
- Project docs
- Development reference

### Roadmaps
- Proposed plans
- Research plans
- Design plans
- Planned implementations
- Active work
- Completed work

## Approach

1. Create critical-paths.md with all paths
2. Organize by category
3. Include full absolute paths
4. Add descriptions for each path
5. Cross-reference with AGENT.md

## Files to Create

- `~/.blackbox5/1-docs/04-project/critical-paths.md`

## Risk Level

LOW - Documentation task only

## Rollback Strategy

Delete file if not needed
