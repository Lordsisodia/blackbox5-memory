# TASK-1738366800: Review and Improve CLAUDE.md Decision Framework

**Type:** analyze
**Priority:** high
**Status:** pending
**Created:** 2026-02-01T05:00:00Z
**Source:** goals.yaml IG-001

## Objective

Analyze the current CLAUDE.md decision framework and identify specific improvements to make decision-making faster and more accurate.

## Context

Per goals.yaml IG-001, the current issues with CLAUDE.md are:
- Decision framework could be more specific
- Context management thresholds may need tuning

This task directly addresses the "Improve CLAUDE.md Effectiveness" improvement goal.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Read and analyze current ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Identify at least 3 specific areas for improvement
- [ ] Document findings in knowledge/analysis/claude-md-improvements.md
- [ ] Provide concrete examples for ambiguous sections
- [ ] Propose tuned context threshold values based on patterns

## Approach

1. Read CLAUDE.md completely
2. Identify decision points that lack specificity
3. Compare against recent run patterns (check runs/completed/)
4. Look for recurring friction points in DECISIONS.md files
5. Synthesize recommendations

## Files to Read

- ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- runs/completed/*/DECISIONS.md (sample 5-10 recent)
- goals.yaml (IG-001 section)

## Files to Create

- knowledge/analysis/claude-md-improvements.md

## Notes

Focus on actionable changes that would reduce hesitation and context overflow exits. Reference specific examples from recent runs where decisions were unclear.
