# TASK-005: Improve Phase Gates Feedback Messages

**Status:** completed
**Priority:** LOW
**Created:** 2026-01-30
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Project:** RALF-CORE

---

## Objective

Improve the feedback messages from phase gates to be more actionable and informative.

## Background

Current phase gate failures just say "cannot proceed" without clear guidance on what's missing. Agent-2.3 should have better feedback.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Update `phase_gates.py` to provide detailed feedback
- [x] List specific missing criteria
- [x] Suggest next steps
- [x] Include examples of what "good" looks like
- [x] Test with failed gates

## Completion

**Completed:** 2026-01-30
**Run Folder:** N/A (direct file creation)
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Path Used:** Quick Flow
**Changes Made:**
- Created `~/.blackbox5/2-engine/.autonomous/lib/phase_gates.py` with improved feedback
- Added detailed feedback configuration for all 8 phase gates
- Implemented `GateCheckResult` dataclass for structured results
- Added `format_gate_result()` for human-readable output
- Included templates for required files (quick_spec.md, plan.md, align.md, etc.)
- Added examples for each exit criterion
- Provided next steps and command reference
- Added `list` command to show available phases
- Tested all functionality successfully

## Example Improved Feedback

Current:
```
Gate failed: cannot_proceed
```

Improved:
```
Gate 'plan_gate' failed - Missing requirements:
  ✗ plan.md not found
  ✗ decision_registry.yaml not found
  ✗ architecture_decisions_documented: false

Next steps:
  1. Create plan.md with architecture decisions
  2. Initialize decision_registry.yaml
  3. Document at least one architecture decision

Example plan.md structure:
  ## Architecture Decisions
  - Decision: [what was decided]
  - Rationale: [why]
  - Alternatives: [what was considered]
```

## Files to Modify

- `~/.blackbox5/2-engine/.autonomous/lib/phase_gates.py`

## Risk Level

LOW - Improves user experience, doesn't change core logic

## Rollback Strategy

Revert to original phase_gates.py if needed
