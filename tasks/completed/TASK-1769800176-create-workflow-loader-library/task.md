## Objective

Create a Python library that provides programmatic access to BMAD workflow YAML files, enabling loading, validation, querying, and export of workflow definitions.

## Success Criteria

- [x] Load all 30 workflow YAML files
- [x] Validate workflow structure and content
- [x] Query workflows by name, command, skill, complexity
- [x] Export workflows to JSON
- [x] Provide comprehensive statistics
- [x] Include 24 unit tests (all passing)
- [x] Include CLI for manual testing

## Context

The system has 30 workflow YAML files created in TASK-1769799720, but no programmatic interface to access them. This creates a gap between having workflow definitions and using them in automation tools, phase gates, and skill routing.

### First Principles Insight

Workflows are data that should be:
1. **Queryable** - Find workflows by various criteria
2. **Validatable** - Ensure structure correctness
3. **Accessible** - Load from any Python code
4. **Integrable** - Export to other formats

## Approach

1. Design dataclasses for workflow components
2. Create Workflow class with full parsing
3. Implement WorkflowLoader with caching
4. Add validation logic
5. Create comprehensive tests
6. Test against actual workflow files

## Files Created

1. `~/.blackbox5/2-engine/.autonomous/lib/workflow_loader.py` (430 lines)
   - Workflow dataclasses
   - WorkflowLoader class
   - Validation methods
   - Statistics and export
   - CLI interface

2. `~/.blackbox5/2-engine/.autonomous/lib/test_workflow_loader.py` (24 tests)
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests with real workflows
   - Edge case coverage

## Results

### Validation
- All 30 workflows loaded successfully
- All workflows pass validation
- 117 total steps across all workflows
- 319 total actions defined

### Test Results
```
Ran 24 tests in 0.844s
OK
```

### Statistics
- By complexity: 2 simple, 20 medium, 8 complex
- By skill: 9 different skills covered
- All workflows have A/P/C menu config
- All workflows have WIP tracking config

## Risk Level

LOW - New library, no changes to existing code

## Rollback Strategy

Delete the two files created:
1. `workflow_loader.py`
2. `test_workflow_loader.py`

No impact on existing functionality.

## Completion

**Run Folder:** /Users/shaansisodia/.blackbox5/5-project-memory/ralf-core/.autonomous/runs/run-1769800176
**Agent:** Agent-2.3
**Path Used:** Quick Flow
**Phase Gates:** N/A (library creation)
**Decisions:** 6 recorded
