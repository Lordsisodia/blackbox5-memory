**Status:** pending
**Priority:** HIGH
**Parent Task:** TASK-ARCH-001
**Created:** 2026-02-04
**Estimated:** 20 minutes

---

## Objective

Apply the architecture analysis framework to the root directory and identify 10 specific improvement opportunities.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Root directory scanned systematically
- [ ] 10 improvement areas identified
- [ ] Each improvement documented with rationale
- [ ] First principles validation applied
- [ ] Improvements scored and prioritized

---

## Analysis Areas

Scan these aspects of root directory:

1. **File Count** - Too many/few files?
2. **Naming Consistency** - Follow conventions?
3. **Documentation Overlap** - Duplicate content?
4. **State Files** - Clear purpose for each?
5. **Cross-References** - Links maintained?
6. **Hierarchy** - Project → Plans → Tasks clear?
7. **Obsolete Files** - Anything outdated?
8. **Missing Files** - Gaps in documentation?
9. **Organization** - Logical grouping?
10. **Accessibility** - Easy to navigate?

## Output Format

For each improvement:

```markdown
## Improvement #[N]: [Title]

**Area:** [which aspect]
**Current State:** [what exists now]
**Proposed Change:** [what to do]
**Rationale:** [why this helps]

**First Principles Check:**
- [ ] Single Source of Truth
- [ ] Convention over Configuration
- [ ] Minimal Viable Documentation
- [ ] Hierarchy of Information

**Impact Score:** [1-5]
**Effort Score:** [1-5]
**Prevention Score:** [1-5]
**Principles Score:** [1-5]
**Weighted Total:** [calculated]
```
