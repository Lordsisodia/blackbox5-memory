**Status:** pending
**Priority:** HIGH
**Parent Task:** TASK-ARCH-001
**Created:** 2026-02-04
**Estimated:** 20 minutes

---

## Objective

Apply the architecture analysis framework to the knowledge/ directory and identify 10 specific improvement opportunities.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Knowledge directory scanned systematically
- [ ] 10 improvement areas identified
- [ ] Each improvement documented with rationale
- [ ] First principles validation applied
- [ ] Improvements scored and prioritized

---

## Analysis Areas

Scan these aspects of knowledge/ directory:

1. **Category Clarity** - Are categories well-defined?
2. **File Organization** - Logical subdirectories?
3. **Duplicate Content** - Same info in multiple places?
4. **Stale Documentation** - Outdated information?
5. **Cross-References** - Links between docs?
6. **Naming Conventions** - Consistent file names?
7. **Accessibility** - Easy to find info?
8. **Completeness** - Gaps in coverage?
9. **Hierarchy** - Clear structure?
10. **Maintenance** - Who updates what?

## Output Format

For each improvement:

```markdown
## Improvement #[N]: [Title]

**Area:** [which aspect]
**Current State:** [what exists now]
**Proposed Change:** [what to do]
**Rationale:** [why this helps]

**First Principles Check:**
- [ ] Single Source of Truth
- [ ] Convention over Configuration
- [ ] Minimal Viable Documentation
- [ ] Hierarchy of Information

**Impact Score:** [1-5]
**Effort Score:** [1-5]
**Prevention Score:** [1-5]
**Principles Score:** [1-5]
**Weighted Total:** [calculated]
```
