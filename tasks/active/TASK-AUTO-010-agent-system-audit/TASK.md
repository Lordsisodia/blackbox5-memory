# TASK: Agent System Audit & Integration Research

**Status:** in_progress
**Priority:** HIGH
**Created:** 2026-02-03
**Task ID:** AGENT-SYSTEM-AUDIT

---

## Objective

Document key learnings from IndyDevDan video and audit Blackbox5 system against these criteria. Research GitHub repos for existing implementations that can fill gaps.

---

## Key Learnings from Video (6 Core Principles)

1. **Task System as Foundation** - Built-in orchestration beats hyped tools
2. **Builder-Validator Pattern** - Minimum viable team structure
3. **Template Metaprompts** - Consistent output through prompt generation
4. **Self-Validation via Hooks** - Agents check their own work
5. **Organization > Agent Count** - Structured communication beats raw numbers
6. **Real Engineering Workflows** - Practical application to existing codebases

---

## Audit Process

For each principle:
1. **Document** what it means
2. **Rate** our current system (0-100)
3. **Identify** gaps/missing pieces
4. **Research** GitHub repos for solutions
5. **Integrate** or build what's needed

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] All 6 principles documented with clear criteria
- [x] Blackbox5 system rated on each principle
- [x] Gap analysis completed for each
- [x] GitHub repo research done for missing pieces
- [x] Integration plan created
