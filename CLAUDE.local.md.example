# Personal Preferences for BlackBox5

This file customizes Claude's behavior for my BB5 workflow.
It extends `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with project-specific preferences.

---

## Output Style Overrides

### Communication
- Default: Follow global ultra-terse style
- Exceptions:
  - Explain reasoning for architecture decisions
  - Verbose mode when I ask "how does X work?"
  - Use tables for multi-item comparisons

### Code Changes
- Always show diff-style output with line numbers
- Include before/after for significant changes
- Group related changes in single block

---

## Agent Preferences

### Default Behavior
- Primary: Direct Claude for most tasks
- Auto-switch to RALF when:
  - Task queue is empty and I say "find work"
  - Continuous iteration needed (pattern matching, refactoring)
  - Long-running background work (>30 min estimated)

### Delegation Rules
- Don't ask before switching — just notify me
- Never delegate security or database changes
- Always delegate "find all occurrences" tasks

---

## bb5 Command Shortcuts

### My Aliases
| Alias | Expands To | When to Use |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| `bb5 here` | `bb5 whereami` | Quick context check |
| `bb5 next` | `bb5 task:list --status=pending --limit=5` | See next tasks |
| `bb5 current` | `bb5 task:current` | What am I working on? |
| `bb5 recent` | `bb5 runs:list --limit=10` | Recent activity |
| `bb5 done` | `bb5 task:complete --with-learnings` | Finish current task |
| `bb5 todo` | `bb5 task:create --template=quick` | Quick task creation |

### Default Flags
- Always use `--with-context` for task creation
- Default sort: priority desc, created asc
- Show task IDs in all lists

---

## Workflow Preferences

### Task Handling
- Auto-claim: Yes, when task is clear and <2 hours
- Auto-create runs: Yes, always create run folder
- Default commit message format: `type(scope): description`

### Documentation Style
- LEARNINGS.md: Required for every run
- DECISIONS.md: When choosing between >2 options
- ASSUMPTIONS.md: Stream of consciousness, don't polish
- RESULTS.md: Bullet points, not prose

### Commit Preferences
```
type(scope): description

- Detail 1
- Detail 2

Task: TASK-XXX
```

Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore
Always include: Task ID, Co-authored-by line

---

## Modified Stop Conditions

### Additional Stop Triggers
- Estimated time >4 hours
- Touching >5 files in critical path
- Changing files I didn't author
- Task description <10 words (clarify first)

### Skip Confirmation For
- Adding tests (even to production code)
- Documentation improvements
- Refactoring with tests in place
- Config updates (non-production)
- File reads and searches

---

## Testing Approach

### Always Write Tests For
- New features
- Bug fixes (regression test)
- Public APIs
- Complex logic (>10 lines)

### Test Style
- Arrange-Act-Assert comments
- Descriptive test names: `should_X_when_Y`
- One assertion per test (preferably)

### Skip Tests For
- Simple getters/setters
- Config files
- Type definitions
- Obvious glue code

---

## Context Management

### At 70% Usage
- Summarize THOUGHTS.md (keep last 10 entries)
- Keep all DECISIONS.md and ASSUMPTIONS.md
- Preserve current task objective

### At 85% Usage
- Complete current subtask
- Exit with PARTIAL status
- Document exact next steps

### What to Preserve
- Current task objective
- Recent decisions (last 5)
- Open questions
- Blockers

---

## Notification Preferences

### Tell Me About
- Task completion (1 line summary)
- Blockers (immediate)
- Unexpected errors (with context)
- Context rollover (brief notice)
- Agent switches

### Don't Tell Me About
- Individual file reads
- Successful tool calls
- Normal workflow steps
- Cache hits

### Progress Updates
- Every 30 minutes for long tasks
- At completion of each subtask
- When switching agents

---

## My Active Goals

### Current Sprint Focus
- Improve task queue processing speed
- Refactor agent communication layer
- Document new autonomous features

### Long-term Objectives
- Achieve 90% autonomous task completion
- Reduce manual intervention to <5%
- Build comprehensive skill library

---

## Known Preferences

### Code Style
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Early returns over nested conditionals
- Descriptive variable names (even if longer)
- Comments explain "why", code explains "what"

### Architecture
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Small, focused modules
- Clear interfaces between components
- Event-driven for async operations

### Documentation
- README for every module
- Docstrings for public APIs
- Examples in documentation
- Keep docs close to code

---

## Overrides from Global

| Global Rule | Local Override | Reason |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Always ask before production code | Skip for tests | Tests are safe to add freely |
| 1-3 line responses | Allow verbose for learning | I want to understand new concepts |
| Default agent: Direct | Auto-delegate pattern tasks | RALF is better at bulk operations |
